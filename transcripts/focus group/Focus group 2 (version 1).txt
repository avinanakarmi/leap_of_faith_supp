No, how long I've been over here,

Speaker 3  7:51  
28 years, and never came in just your life. The year, when it was before she caught the

Unknown Speaker  8:06  
stove, she was getting better, but she was very like

Some attention. See, you.

Unknown Speaker  10:59  
In the business, in the best interest of time. In the best Interest what?

Speaker 2  11:30  
Of chicken, beef, through it, let's give a minute more, and then we can start talking about this a little bit. So

Unknown Speaker  12:18  
did you all get a chance to read through This?

Unknown Speaker  12:29  
Any thoughts, first thoughts,

Speaker 1  12:31  
primaras, pensamientos, comentarios. First thoughts,

Speaker 1  12:45  
she said here it says that there's no lead in the 224 to 25 graph. Is that

Unknown Speaker  12:52  
certain? That's the data we got from

Speaker 1  12:56  
ng to trust. NG. Njd, njt, DDP, Ng, DP only department, the New Jersey. So that was meaning the website they stopped.

Speaker 2  13:14  
I'm curious what made you question? What made you question that?

Speaker 1  13:19  
What happened? Always do that this? They went to my house, they said that there was a little lead in the water.

Speaker 2  13:33  
And now that you heard that this is coming from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, how do you feel about this shot this data

Speaker 1  13:42  
sabiendo que este dato viene de gobierno de New Jersey del Estado e Service came to Aguas Ariel poco de moment que piensas de timeformas Young presented beautiful.

Unknown Speaker  14:03  
Like they lied to me, they lied. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 4  14:15  
Concern was with the data that is presented here. You can see in the most recent years, it shows there's almost no lead in the water. It's very little down here. And she was skeptical about that, and once we let her know where we got the data from, she feels like the government of the department lied to

Speaker 1  14:32  
her, because when she did the testing in her home, they found small traces of lead in her water. So she's saying, How is there lead in my water? But within the state graph, they're saying there's no lead. She felt like she was like,

Speaker 2  14:54  
based on all of your lived experiences, based on all of your lived experience. Says, Do you have any other thoughts about this

Speaker 1  15:05  
basado en otras experiencias?

Unknown Speaker  15:20  
When they talk about that,

Speaker 3  15:23  
I think most of the time when I'm getting information, either on the radio or something like that, I'm just glad that they they care, especially with the young people, because they don't coming into the school all them trying to get water and stuff from the same fountain and stuff that's nasty.

Unknown Speaker  15:48  
Yeah, that's a good point. Yes, then wanting to share that information and

Unknown Speaker  16:01  
and thinking about this information that you saw on these on this paper, would you trust it?

Speaker 1  16:10  
You can send a line for mercy on que le Aron en el puppet, confian en los datos. I don't

Speaker 3  16:24  
I trust information, but I just me being made alone. It makes me feel like I can't trust them. Who's that? This company, I wouldn't be able to trust them. Like, okay, when I come out for PSC and G, they come somewhere. They can't really tell me nothing if they don't have to act the pipes, right? They, you know, stick those to be making up things, no. So I believe I'd rather call the company itself and find out what's going on.

Speaker 1  17:07  
So you think if you were to call the company and hear it from somebody, some actual person, you would trust it more

Speaker 3  17:15  
a little bit what I would like if there's if there are any changes, then I would rather take the time to on three long if you can easily do a card or a conversation. You know, because we got a little kids that don't really know what's going on, and they don't know they just put in their mouths and stuff like that.

Speaker 1  17:39  
Yeah, so conversation or a letter at home would be something you would trust.

Speaker 3  17:46  
Is that what I have, I have back, back, if I had to review something? Well, someone came to me and I told them, maybe the wrong phone, the right thing, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  18:00  
How about others? What about trusting this information?

Speaker 2  18:18  
And there's no right or wrong answer basically how you feel about it, honestly, we want to

Speaker 1  18:27  
hear that see the soloist los sentimentos Late.

Unknown Speaker  18:41  
Wherever you all is well, good, good, yes, sir.

Speaker 5  19:08  
Sometimes, I think she made a good point about that water, and like in the members talking about it earlier, about how we noticed something was going wrong, and we stopped water in the parks, and we stopped the water in the schools, so they shut that off. And I was glad to hear her say that, you know, acknowledge that, you know, I mean, like, you know, drinking water after the people and foul ends, and once they start cutting the water off in the parks, it was like opening people's eyes and let them see something's got to be wrong some day there. So I think what they could is about acknowledging that she always like, you know, she always, she always like bottled water. That's what she know, you know. I mean, she likes bottled water, corporate lifestyle, you know? I mean, before the stroke. So, you know, she likes that type of, you know.

Speaker 1  20:00  
Is it because you are more, you trust more that it's a that it's clean water, yeah?

Speaker 5  20:06  
Well, she do like for me, when we, when I, when I take her to Costcos, I buy, I buy the Costco brand, but to her, she'll buy the Polo. And I try to tell her, Look, maybe that's too much. I don't know. You don't say I, you know, because sometime I read before, like I was telling you, I read about a couple of years, years ago, about Polo. Wasn't all Polo. I don't know what the trustee, you know what I mean, she wants to pay the higher price and sometimes. But I'm like, Just get the cut

Speaker 3  20:40  
if you but you can actually taste if you put, let's say, two pearls, one, hopefully from Crystal, or you could taste the difference, because you already have minerals and stuff in your body, so that's one nothing for one leg. So you could do still taste. You could taste it, you know, something is wrong. And then when you walk it up to any of the fountains, and either there's no one really over there, or they have the tape and stuff around that, that's that's even worse.

Unknown Speaker  21:15  
Yeah, when they covered all the mountains, yeah,

Speaker 2  21:18  
yeah, they did that at our university too, exactly, and, yeah, but thinking about like you're seeing you're seeing this happen in life, right? You're seeing this water fountains or water like because of lead issue, they are being closed at that point of time. If you had information like this, Would it be helpful?

Unknown Speaker  21:51  
See,

Unknown Speaker  22:01  
okay? And

Unknown Speaker  22:08  
in those media, C says one boy,

Unknown Speaker  22:19  
you Know, reclamatic. Antes de que se mandaron los abisos Anticipate formation is a lot closer see

Speaker 1  22:58  
you that OC confiaba And explain, if it's explained, well,

Speaker 1  23:19  
if it's too complicated, it's too complicated, it's explained.

Speaker 2  23:27  
And would it? Would you trust this information? Like or like, what aspects of this language, what it is written, how it is explained, or the visual, all of that, would you trust it? Or are there things that may bring questions to you. Like, I don't think, I don't really see that. Like, who is giving me this information?

Speaker 3  23:46  
Well, I think for me, it's different, because I have machine. We just always there so, but sometimes, when,

Unknown Speaker  24:02  
especially because you have

Speaker 3  24:04  
to be more about the kitchen, trying to get everything as well. But I am we used to when we were younger. My mother used to say what she was telling me to take the water and clean it. I'm like, how did you it's water and it's they already have it purified, I thought, but they're saying that they're not. So that's why, before you put, you know, eating your food and things like that you're supposed to boil the water. No, that's too much.

Speaker 1  24:45  
That's like, yeah, I would boil water. Boiling water doesn't get rid of lead. Unfortunately, it makes it worse, because the heat does something to the lead particles, and it. Comes a higher.

Speaker 5  25:03  
Last class I was talking about from old school, I thought that boiling wants a boiler to take out everything See what I'm saying, but it's don't learn something. I'm thinking like when I've been to boil something, it'll be purified. Anything was the heat hit out there until you said that, you know, like, you can boil it, but that ain't gonna take out the lead. I didn't know that. Remember earlier today, I was like, boiled and thinking that it would pull out water and sitting on the stove, and next day, you know, thought it was better that way, if I didn't have bottled

Speaker 1  25:40  
water, it does kill bacteria, right, right? So things like that will leave the water, but things like lead, which is a metal, it won't evaporate away, it'll stay. And the heat of it actually makes it even higher concentration, so that's why. But yeah, whenever you use water from your faucet, always use a cold water, as opposed to hot water. Yeah, if you're

Speaker 5  26:07  
gonna drink or boil it, well, use the cold

Speaker 1  26:11  
yeah, because when the hot water goes through the pipes, and if you have bad pipes, not saying you do, right, just in general, and the hot water from those pipes makes the lead on in the pipes leach out. Always let your water run and use it cold. Solo saka bacteria, plomo como metal sequeidan. Agua is mass calor law, as in concentration must alto solo puedes filtrar, Plum model.

Speaker 2  26:58  
So what you're hearing is like, how information is power, right, like, like you described, right, knowing that hot water, if you, even if you boil the water, lead, cannot go away. So, information is power. But how do we convey that information right in the right way? How do we reach people in the right way? What should we say so, and what makes an information trustworthy versus not trustworthy.

Speaker 1  27:25  
SK, information, CS, for the estimate for the pero como uno receiver information, como lo confia, c una confia, so como podemos cambia esto, paque, uno puede mejorar of intended must pass. He must wrap you, though, is the information case being important,

Speaker 2  27:48  
and that's what we want to understand, which is why we want your feedback on. Like, these are, I know like, these are paper, like, lot of text and stuff, but we really want your feedback on, essentially, like, the language that is being used, what is confusing? What what you trust, what you don't trust, what aspects make you trust versus not trusted? If you can share, if everyone would share, the

Speaker 3  28:14  
thoughts first, sorry, we all have our hands, our first habits we don't want to change. I'm so used to doing things way, that way,

Unknown Speaker  28:32  
especially for the younger chart, or something. What?

Speaker 2  28:45  
Then, for the younger generation, the charts for I love that. What you brought up charts for young why not? Why younger generation?

Speaker 3  28:59  
Because they are the ones that really that is, is using, they're one that's using the water product and stuff. Because most of the adults you out trying to get work, or you at work severe had time to be thinking about water all the time.

Speaker 2  29:18  
So what if you were to get this kind of information. What would you prefer, personally? So for younger people who said that, maybe chance or something like that, personally for you, what would you prefer?

Speaker 3  29:33  
I'm good with just receiving it at my house, because I have that's what I've been drinking, and it's they use the water at like the hospitals and stuff like that. So that makes me feel sure that

Speaker 2  29:55  
okay. But I love the point that you brought up chance for younger people. It's. I'm gonna we'll come back to it if we have some time later again in the meantime, if we'd love to hear from everyone about like, thoughts about trust, what aspects make you trust this information or even not trust this and you can be brutal. You know, something cannot come here, and you already brought up, right? The graph. Graph did not note like the chart did not note that you're and you found lead in your house, but the chart did not note that

Speaker 1  30:39  
something like that. Contrast. Los, no reflex experience, yeah, let's

Speaker 1  30:54  
do anything. So look when there was my Can You see that?

Speaker 1  31:17  
Arit, let any go. Comment so low phone and program.

Speaker 3  31:28  
Now, what I really think about the young people, like we would play so tired, you will be thirsty, so you will go in the house. But the kids today, they have too many sodas, all that sweet stuff, so they're not getting the same ingredient that we got. I know for myself, You

Unknown Speaker  32:16  
and I'm sorry,

Speaker 1  32:41  
if they, she said was on the first page. But here she circled this front part, and she said that she had heard of lead, but had no I really idea or any background about it. She led. She read here, and she said that it was really clear, and she was learning. She just learned a lot more what it's about. And then on the back, she also saw the graph, and she said that when they did the test of her house, it did come up Positive, but that was in the paint, okay,

Unknown Speaker  33:37  
sitting on

Speaker 2  33:44  
it. Did it raise so reading this now that you did not know about lead as much reading this, did it raise new questions for you that you are now more curious about and you would want to know more

Speaker 1  33:59  
about, trauma. No severe system aura lay in the air, the mass the problem it was

Speaker 1  34:26  
A yeah so. And also looking at this image here, and seeing the parts that it looks like you need to replace a lot of tubes so that they don't

Unknown Speaker  34:50  
wear away, and leash LED. And

Speaker 1  34:53  
I said, Yes, yeah, that's what the image shows. Also, like, I asked her if she read the small letterings, or if it was just too small. She said, No, I read it.

Speaker 2  35:13  
And does she trust it? All of this information. How about you? Also like, Would you trust this information? What's in this

Unknown Speaker  35:26  
information? Yes, because

Speaker 3  35:31  
me, I've been in my own house, that makes me pitch. It makes me aware of what it is not what it should be. So now I'm like, wow, I think about I'm quickly, you just keep throwing water, but you need to hold on to it, because sometimes what happens if we have, they have some issues with the water, we might be in bad trouble. What they said,

Speaker 5  36:02  
You can't smell that. You know you can't smell that's why it was good for them to contest.

Speaker 2  36:17  
What was the what? Sorry? Would you? Would she trust it? Sorry?

Unknown Speaker  36:21  
Do you remember she said yes, because for her, it makes sense that old

Unknown Speaker  36:30  
tubes and old pipes would be harmful to somebody

Speaker 2  36:40  
just curious to hear from all of you while she's giving us another sheet. Where do you think this information might be coming from? If

Unknown Speaker  37:07  
a health center or Yeah, because the House

Speaker 2  37:18  
Center, actually the health center, and you trust the information from there? Would you trust the information from health departments?

Unknown Speaker  37:34  
Yes, I used to work in the it was the affairs of

Speaker 3  37:44  
the they first started talking about things that was in the water, and we were all younger. Then it's cool, right? So we didn't really take it serious. But then one day, one of our classmates came out like crazy, and he had got messed up all in the face. Like, I don't know what it was hot or cold at that time, but that's one of the things that prompted them to make sure it's got to be get it and make sure it's right, it's on and stuff like that.

Unknown Speaker  38:22  
No, yeah,

Speaker 2  38:28  
we read this, and this is similar conversation, but in a slightly different tone. It's all about creating the awareness right among people and like we like we talked about it. How do we reach people at the place where they are? Which tone connects with people? So this one had one tone, this one has a slightly different so we would love to hear from, yeah, different version. So which resonates more with you and how you feel about it. Again, no, no right or Wrong. Again, like which? How?

Speaker 1  39:41  
That so we have a different variant of the message written out different.

Unknown Speaker  40:08  
Own a different style. So we'd like for you to take

Speaker 2  40:18  
a look at this. Share your thoughts. I can just whatever comes to your mind. You can, we can talk about it once

Speaker 1  40:27  
you understand better. She confused mind easier. We can just talk here, yeah, okay, I was just laughing because

Unknown Speaker  40:34  
since I'm the doorway, I'm on my phone number,

Speaker 6  40:40  
since I'm not doing well, I'm not feeling good, because I had the stroke, and one of my girlfriends,

Unknown Speaker  40:46  
she thought I was like, she was like, Do you ever get and she was

Speaker 6  40:53  
saying, Well, you know, to make sure you you're doing right, right with the water. And I was sure enough, when I looked up in my mail,

Speaker 3  41:03  
I swear I said, Oh, guess what. You talked it up. What did she say? Again, she was asking me, did I add I did I have, did I have a moment to talk to you? Because she said they had stopped. They ever walked. The people were walking around, talking about it, trying to get us noticed, to notice what's happening with the water.

Speaker 6  41:22  
And I was, I was like doing that, you know?

Unknown Speaker  41:26  
And it's just funny because I

Unknown Speaker  41:29  
came home and then I seen a letter

Unknown Speaker  41:32  
that meant it was made for me, yeah.

Speaker 2  41:34  
And how did that make you feel that letter? What was in that letter?

Unknown Speaker  41:39  
It makes me feel that whoever it is,

Speaker 7  41:48  
trying to make sure we have the protects and stuff like that.

Speaker 3  41:55  
So I'm not worried. You tell me this is how it is, and you make this it's

Unknown Speaker  42:04  
good because you're keeping the words for others outside.

Unknown Speaker  42:09  
I really like, I like sweets

Speaker 2  42:16  
and sodas. She wants some sugar, but also curious to hear rock house. What do you think about like the versions

Speaker 5  42:33  
it appears like this is a little different than the first one I read today. Yeah, I noticed that. So, you know, my assumption said I'm gonna be seeing the same thing, but I see, you never know. You can't assume anything, right? So I'm seeing the rules when they say, you know certain things you know, like, you know, like, where the health standards and the health might say some standards, and the government might see another standards, like we you know, it's different views and opinions. So

Speaker 2  43:05  
feel as the end person who is receiving all this information, the health saying something different, the government saying something different, like, how does that make you feel?

Speaker 5  43:15  
Make Me Feel sometime confused. That's what

Speaker 2  43:21  
you want to get at, right representing this information. What? Who do you think this information is coming from? And who would you want this information to come from?

Speaker 5  43:32  
Well, she made a good point, talking about the health department, the city, the government, you know. It's a lot of versions of people like, you know, but what I do, like is I'm starting to acknowledge and know that they doing construction. I'm seeing it with my own eyes. They taking out the pipes, which they didn't do in 2019 that they said they did, and they got paid for, but they didn't do that, which they what they stated on here. And I didn't see that when I on the papers, but when I read off the tablet, I saw that they knew about that in 2019 and they didn't do anything about it, really, but they said they did. So sometimes you just can't believe what you hear. People can tell you that they doing it, but you actually got to see it like now. You see a lot of construction going on, not just in [city]. I'm seeing it in other towns as well, and it's like a lot of roadblocks. Like, why is the roadblock? But I see they're digging, taking out old pipes and old things, which is a good thing. Like, she stayed it's better for the younger generation and other kids and other people to make it better. Like, so people are starting to notice. So had to be somebody starting to report things or say certain things, and now they're starting to look into it and investigate it and starting to do something about it. Now that's what they need to do. They need to do something about it.

Speaker 2  44:59  
But first. Ari, I hear you, like, when you say they, who are you holding? Who would you hold responsible

Speaker 5  45:09  
city, the government. I mean, that's why hold responsible they got, I believe they got the testers to really test the water. I believe they know basically, what's going on, you know, like, far as you know, like, what's happening, but they would tell us some other stuff. The Keith was at bay, but, you know, but to see it now, they take an action, and promptly admitted in 2019 that they knew about it. But now it's doing something about it. They're taking action.

Speaker 2  45:41  
I'm worse than you personally at your level, right? If you are getting this information, what kind of action would you take?

Speaker 5  45:51  
What kind of action would I take? I would start coming to more things in like this, and read them more. I like to read a lot anyway. So I like to read a lot and type of information and stuff, different things, and who I'm getting information from, because a lot of times it can be like, they say fake news. They can be fake stuff. And listening to you guys, I know that you came from a college, so that's telling me to reading something at college. You're studying some things. You're studying about what's going on. So, you know, I stay open to that, because I know you're looking into things

Speaker 2  46:29  
coming from I love that. I love that point. You brought that up again. I love that. That's good. I want to touch base here a reading thread. Yeah, actually, yes. Maybe if, if you could also read through both the versions and tell us, like, give some feedback on which version you like personally, better. It's kind of similar information in both, but we want to get your feedback so that, if we are building a tool, we learn like, which message is conveyed better.

Speaker 5  47:02  
My of both of them is knowledgeable. To me, the way you perceive it some people might perceive, and I might have, from the first version, I might have overlooked something so I was able to see it in the second version, both of them is good. I would say both of them is very helpful.

Speaker 2  47:26  
So the second one was the second one was, which ones you said that you could see things that you had overlooked in the first

Speaker 5  47:36  
one the way it was worded, the way it was worded, the way it was said. I started basically almost, almost the same thing, but it's just a different way to view. It, different way to look you want

Speaker 5  48:02  
to go. As the first page in the second page, what do you think is best? And

Speaker 3  48:20  
from especially the last thing, because it get it, it put me where I need to know I wasn't really understanding it, because if I'm not in that field, but after I heard anybody talking, and then I thought about my house and times that I've been called on Bill time

Speaker 8  48:44  
right now.

Unknown Speaker  48:57  
So water.

Speaker 2  49:04  
Any thoughts on which one you prefer between the two, or,

Speaker 5  49:14  
personally, maybe the second, where leads come from, as a strainer. But they were saying the same thing in the beginning. The same thing where the leg comes from, the groove, you know, stuff like that. So basically, it's almost the same thing with this, you know, maybe

Speaker 2  49:40  
and I do want to talk hear your thoughts about a little bit more about trusting this information, right? Because what you brought up is very important, right? The city is saying something the health department the environment. The government is saying something like at different levels, right? The government is saying something and then you work with New York Water Coalition, you have a relationship with them, right? And you might be hearing things from them also. So thinking about like, what information and how you trust information, right? I want to just first hear your thoughts about that, which ones you trust more, or which ones make you question a bit more things like that.

Speaker 5  50:28  
Trust more, yeah, water people, yeah.

Speaker 2  50:32  
Or it's not like comparing, but more like thinking about like, something like we just saw right in New York, there has been lead in water, but still the the graph showed that there is no water, there is no lead, right? So thinking and then there can be information conveyed by different agencies. So that's what I'm trying to say. Like thinking about who do you associate your trust with? Are there particular agencies you trust more? Are there particular groups like New York water condition you trust more. I trust myself

Speaker 3  51:06  
and stuff like that in my house. So when I get documentation from PSAP, no water in water, my utilities, both of them,

Unknown Speaker  51:18  
I can't I go out quickly because I'm quickly, because I know

Speaker 3  51:24  
that, especially when we're being sick, I wasn't home to be able to stay on the phone so they look bad. If you're trying to confront the person, you didn't know

Speaker 5  51:42  
what to sell it, but I She's asking the question, Who do you really trust? Do you trust anybody for the water company? Like, do Who do you trust? Do you trust these people? Like, is it hard for you to trust? Is it hard for Who do you really trust? Do you trust anybody? Made a statement here, but the statement is not true. So who do you trust? The

Speaker 5  52:19  
second person like me. It's hard to believe, it's hard to trust, because, you know, it's different things. So you got to continue to read up on stuff, you know, and seeing where the source is function, who I'm dealing with, who I'm talking to, you know, who was, who was looking up information, who's trying to find some, some true facts? Yeah, so it's just very important for me to know the source, or who was on getting the source from just because the water company don't mean they telling me the truth. They may might just be wanting to tell me what I want to hear, like they was doing on this paper. They told me what I wanted to hear, which was a fact that it wasn't true. They were saying one thing, but it was another thing. And I found myself that happens a lot. You know, sometimes they tell the country and they tell the city what they wanted to tell them, for nobody. Don't panic or whatever the case may be, and you know, but they don't tell the whole truth. Sometimes they don't tell the whole truth. So it's up to you to read about it, and you know, and get some good information from some type of good source that you feel comfortable with.

Speaker 2  53:23  
I love that. Okay, I cannot get this out of my head. It's on you to read upon about it. But also, can I come back to this question on Can I ask about question about this responsibility? I think we talked about it a little bit in the first session too. But so the whole idea we're showing this is we want your feedback so that we, if we are, when we are building it on a website or an app, we will be presenting information in a similar way. So if some a website like this existed, where you can go and understand and ask questions no information about New York's water quality, who would you feel comfortable to be accountable and responsible for it like let's say, if you know that this website is the information on this website is provided by NJIT versus New York Water Coalition versus the city of New York. I'm just giving examples. Right? If you know that, oh, this party is responsible for the information that is being shown or is responsible for this website? Who would you associate that trust with? Like, who do you want to be responsible for this? That's my question. I would think maybe

Speaker 5  54:33  
the water people, the water they should know, the water polishing should know what's going on with the water, because before it comes out to us, they should be being tested. It should be, you know, somebody should be responsible. But checking the water before you decipher the water to the people, yeah, I would think that you know the water coalition should know you know more than anybody else, because they. Working Hands On with the water. So it's pretty much low, you know, if it's terminated, if it got lead or not being properly, you know, the way it should be. So I would think the water comes

Speaker 2  55:14  
this year. Yeah, that's a great point. So the reason I'm asking this is there could be two scenarios, right? This information could be provided from different organizations, government organizations. We can get this information, but this information can also be additionally vetted by New York Water Coalition, and then it goes to residents in somewhere. Which one would you prefer?

Unknown Speaker  55:43  
That can be printed by anybody.

Speaker 2  55:45  
So, for example, here, here it says, according to EPA, lead enters the water. So this information is coming from EPA, let's say or this information is coming from the the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protections, right? So this information is coming from government agencies, but there could be a lot of information that government agencies have, right? I'm not telling or even on their website is public. Also, there could be a lot of information, but what information should be presented and how accurate they think it is for New Jersey, for [city] residents, right? So if that is in a way, like vetted, or like this information is vetted by [city] Water Coalition, how would you feel about

Unknown Speaker  56:41  
that the water little not

Speaker 5  56:48  
perfect, accurate, coming from them, but that don't necessarily mean it can be true, because it came from them.

Speaker 2  56:57  
So the final responsibility is something you would hold to yourself. Responsibility that of checking that this information is correct, you wouldn't. You wouldn't hold New York Water Coalition responsible if the or like, let's say, if the city of New York is providing this you wouldn't hold them responsible

Speaker 5  57:23  
for responsible for they're not doing they're supposed to be doing. They are responsible. They're not doing what they're supposed to be doing, and that's a proven fact. They wasn't doing like they stated they didn't. They received the funding, but they wasn't changing the pipes going on, but now, you know, yeah, they're responsible for that. So they responsible for a lot of people getting sick. That's why a lot of people later on down the road get sued from things that they knew about and they didn't do anything about. So

Speaker 2  58:01  
there is a lot of what I'm hearing is, and what, to some extent, I've heard about, like, what I'm hearing is, there's a lot of historical context to it, right? Like people knowing about things, not doing it, how information is conveyed, how it is acted upon. Do you think like in the middle of all of this, in this larger context, would having actually information like this on a website or app would be helpful? Would you actually look into it? Would you read it on

Unknown Speaker  58:42  
the app? I or

Speaker 2  58:44  
would it become something like just another AB that people will not use? So

Speaker 5  58:52  
maybe it's all depends on individual, individuals not going to read, individuals not going to do something. But if you care about your community, care about your health, and you know, when it talks about the food, if it talks about water, you know? I mean, you know, you should read up on that. You should see where it's coming from, what you know. But we got individuals that, like she would state now that some people don't care, they think is not going to harm you now they're young. They just not true like that. They don't take heed. Sometimes it's good for the parents to pretty, you know, help them with that, to talk to them about this stuff. Very educational. And I

Speaker 2  59:35  
love that you brought up, right? Like talking in your household about it, in a way, right? That's the level of awareness that would be the that would be an amazing goal to have, like talking it in your house. But actually, I wanted to You were saying something about your son in something right now, or did you lose it? He's not.

Speaker 9  1:00:03  
It, light, light, light, I guess with light, that's important, so he'll know what he's Yeah, that's

Speaker 3  1:00:25  
another thing I like, because everything everywhere, but I learned to be my my man, and see where everything includes it. So it's not bad now, but you Know, punch up everything like

Unknown Speaker  1:00:51  
crunch up everything.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:02  
That's okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:15  
Maybe would not believe it, because information,

Speaker 2  1:01:28  
people need to get together. Yeah, and if you could build something that lets people get together? So I have a question, which is like the way information is explained on these does it affect if you trust it or not trust it? Does it affect your trust in some way?

Speaker 5  1:01:53  
Not really, because a lot of stuff I trust, I like what I'm reading education there, I learned some stuff today, you know, you know, some need to take heed a lot of good information.

Speaker 5  1:02:17  
You know, just keep, just keep, stay open and keep reading about the things that's going on, and looking also as well to see what are they doing to make changes, not just talking about changes, but making the changes like I'm seeing now with the roads, I'm seeing the pipes coming up. I'm seeing roads getting shut down detours. So that's telling me that they're going under the ground. I'm also seeing that they certain places. They put stuff on your door, and they tell you that they, you know, the water, people have been around. They want to make some changes, do some things, you know. And that's good to know. That's good to know they're coming out in the areas and trying to do some changes.

Speaker 2  1:02:56  
So that is something you would also want to know, right? If some a portal like if a website like this existed, you would want to know what changes they are making to

Speaker 5  1:03:04  
communication is key. I would like to know what when they're doing and when it's done. You know, when is they going to take action, when it's going to be starting, or when is it, in effect, what are they doing? You know? I mean, yeah, information is always educated.

Speaker 2  1:03:21  
And you said that you'd feel comfortable if New York Water Coalition was responsible for such a website, right? So in some

Speaker 5  1:03:30  
way, should be responsible. They're the experts in this.

Speaker 3  1:03:33  
In some way they should be the one to own it. Own up to because that's their business. And if they want to make to get to that

Unknown Speaker  1:03:46  
kid do by yourself, to know what they're doing that

Unknown Speaker  1:04:07  
okay and Tell them what they should they don't even

Speaker 9  1:04:19  
know what they should do, they don't even know what you're talking about. So we're things coming, and

Unknown Speaker  1:04:26  
people don't pass or they don't

Unknown Speaker  1:04:28  
have information.

Speaker 9  1:04:30  
You can't do anything because you wasn't paying attention, because

Unknown Speaker  1:04:33  
you got to hear it from somewhere. Sometime,

Speaker 5  1:04:37  
I think you made a good point about, you know, like when you said in the hospital where you felt safe, you thought it should be good. When you talked about the hospital money should be sufficient. You know, it should be good for you notice, like that was a good point. You feel they keep things clean. They wipe down. And things all the time. So when you go into the hospital, you feel secure about getting the water. You know, you feel different. It seems as though they're going to make sure that, you know, hospitals in certain areas are more

Unknown Speaker  1:05:16  
typical care made as priorities as priorities to come out and take care of the

Speaker 5  1:05:28  
system. They don't want something falling back on them. Yeah, I think

Speaker 2  1:05:37  
these were most of the questions we wanted to ask, I think the last question is mostly like, I think if we were building this tool, like the AI tool for which was on a website where it shows information about New York water quality, how do you think, how would You want residents of New York to be

Speaker 5  1:06:07  
involved, if they could, to come out, be more supportive, you know, I mean, to find out the information, to come out and get involved in order To see what's going on. Because the more the people, the better it is, and they're better to spread the word, you know. So I would like them to get involved, but again, they got to be willing to want to do that. They willing. They do that. Willingness is the key to anything, to me, anything in life. If you're not willing, you're not going to

Unknown Speaker  1:06:40  
do it. So you want people to be more

Unknown Speaker  1:06:42  
like active in thinking about

Speaker 5  1:06:45  
water, active about being more conscious about their health, about more conscious about their kids, like she talked about, I think I said that earlier too, about, you know, the younger generation, you know, I mean, like, you know, the new generation that's coming after us is that, you know the make sure that things they liked, it was 50 years ago, 35 years old. You want better stuff. You want better things, you know, so

Speaker 2  1:07:11  
I love the generational part. You brought up. I love, I think you brought up about, like, the charts are for younger people. The charts. She said that the charts are for younger

Unknown Speaker  1:07:21  
people. The charts, what made you

Speaker 3  1:07:30  
say that? Like, what were you thinking in any household? They showed me where have nothing

Unknown Speaker  1:07:50  
to do. They really don't have anything

Unknown Speaker  1:07:59  
to do. Trouble. Anything to

Unknown Speaker  1:08:06  
do. I got two fans.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:09  
My son is autistic, nonverbal.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:12  
I'm going through things,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:15  
and they just walking around here.

Speaker 2  1:08:19  
I really appreciate what you brought up, right? Because thinking about the reality of life, right, and thinking about this information that's on here, do you think.
