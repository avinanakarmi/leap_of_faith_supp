Unknown Speaker  0:03  
The personal context,

Unknown Speaker  0:07  
is it recording? Okay? So

Speaker 1  0:14  
welcome everyone. Thank you. Really want to thank you all for taking the time out and for joining us here today. We really want your feedback. So for some context, we have been trying to build an AI assisted tool to provide insights about water quality. And we've been building this with with a lot of feedback from [community-leader]. But at the end of the day, if this is a tool that is supposed to be helpful for you, we want to hear from you, if it is if something like this would make sense, right? So the kind of information that this tool would provide, the kind of messages, the insights, the infographics, everything it provides, we want to hear from you, and this is what we want your honest feedback on. You can be critical about it as well. We appreciate that.

<moderator-1>  1:00  
Is there anything you want to add about the background? No, I think you what you will see in these handouts are some messages about water quality. Specifically, this is about the cause of lead in water and, yeah, like we'll give like, six to eight minutes, yeah, so you take some time to read through, and we'll

Unknown Speaker  1:27  
ask you some questions before we proceed. Do you have any questions for us?

Speaker 1  1:33  
Okay, if we ever use, just to make sure that if we ever use any of your insights in any publication, we often, we will anonymize like we don't reveal any idea. Information. We just want to make sure,

<moderator-1>  1:46  
just like when you fill out the survey, right? So everything is anonymous.

Speaker 2  2:22  
You're also,

Speaker 1  2:29  
if you have questions as you're reading through this right? In case you have any questions, thoughts, comments, you want to highlight those parts, we would really appreciate that, like things that you are like, Oh, this doesn't make sense to me. Oh, I have so many questions after reading this part. Like, we would love for you to highlight those things like, oh, I don't trust this thing, things like that.

Speaker 3  2:55  
So what happens when the water, when turn, when you turn on, the water Brown? What is that?

Unknown Speaker  3:03  
Sorry, could you repeat that again

Speaker 3  3:05  
when you turn on the water and if it looks brown, what does that mean? That's a

Speaker 1  3:09  
great impression, right? And I think I had to bed like another sheet, which was around.

Speaker 3  3:20  
Excuse me. I heard you say, so what did you say? Let me just dirty. I figured that.

Unknown Speaker  3:27  
But what made you come up

Unknown Speaker  3:36  
with that question?

Speaker 3  3:39  
When I first moved out here, when I first moved out here to be originally from Europe, and moved out here, it was lead in the water, so we had to use bottled water. They were giving water. Also was given free water. I've been using them in what is since I don't use no what

Speaker 1  4:08  
you all are saying is really important for us. Is it okay if I turn out another audio recorder? Sorry.

Unknown Speaker  4:21  
Thank you.

Speaker 4  4:27  
Did you need help with the reading? Is it too small? She can't see without her glasses. She don't have her glasses.

Unknown Speaker  4:38  
Why did you just read it to her? She was it

Speaker 5  4:51  
to her. We'll give her one of the iPads she can zoom into this.

Unknown Speaker  5:02  
Can go you

Speaker 5  5:08  
don't need to take the trouble. We will give you one on iPad. You can, you can enlarge it.

Unknown Speaker  5:15  
No, the pencil for something else. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  5:19  
Do you need to highlight anything

Unknown Speaker  5:27  
that's not my phone? Okay,

Speaker 1  5:32  
some information. And you're like, Oh, I think I'm not sure if this is 100% correct. Oh, I don't really understand what this is saying. Or, like, I wouldn't trust this or this is making me ask so many questions. If any of this information you see on this paper, I would love for you to highlight it so we would love to get a sense. Like, how do we How should AI tools even present this kind of information? Do?

Speaker 3  6:03  
It, oh yes, thank you. Okay, it's even better for me. Thank you. I

Unknown Speaker  6:30  
A this is

Speaker 6  6:40  
boy, tomorrow's Saturday. I got

Speaker 7  6:48  
blessed for my son. They doing. They giving away uniforms tomorrow at my son's school, only for Michelle Obama, the one on 14 foot up. Yeah, that was blessed because I was about to go spend some cash. So what I was gonna buy for him, I could buy for my other son, I was blessed with uniforms. I guess I'm gonna be donating some school supplies here, because I don't need the school supplies

Unknown Speaker  7:29  
that they get they're Giving me. She's in high school now, right Westside location, know, okay, okay, but as you're

Speaker 1  8:01  
reading through it, also if, if you have like questions or thoughts you'd love

Speaker 8  8:12  
to Hear about they tested. I knew before

Unknown Speaker  8:18  
they tested it. No more. Why? Well, to me, honestly, is

Speaker 1  8:37  
this because of the tap water, or is it like different?

Unknown Speaker  8:44  
I'm trying my best to stay away from the hands and try hard.

Speaker 1  8:52  
So did you all have a chance to read through the paper? But original, like it would be on a interface, like on a on your mobile,

<moderator-1>  9:06  
or two, essentially together with [community-leader], but we're giving you paper handouts because you're used to paper so and then we will gradually move to digital. Any thoughts you would like to share.

Speaker 8  9:18  
How do you do you permanently fix this? Because he's probably

Speaker 1  9:31  
So, how do you fix it? That's that's a question that comes to your mind.

Speaker 8  9:35  
No filters like but you have to keep constantly doing that. What can they do to actually permanently? Was, when they came to testify with her, they were like, you can't, you know, you shouldn't be cooking with that. You really shouldn't be washing with it, like, so you know how expensive bottle was. Yes, if you want to wash with it, cook with it, do everything with it.

Speaker 1  10:04  
The question that comes to your mind is, how do I fix it permanently? Right is

Speaker 7  10:08  
to make iced tea, you gotta make bottled water.

Speaker 1  10:13  
What about others? What questions? So seeing this kind of information, what questions come to your mind, just

Speaker 8  10:21  
my main concern is, like, the things you can avoid, like a shower. I can't take a shower with bottled water, so I'm in the water.

Speaker 9  10:29  
Regardless, mine is, I got a couple. This is, this is talk about. This is not just an issue about the pipes. It's about people. I never knew that just, you know, it's about people. It's not just about the pipes. And, you know, they talked about, you cannot, you cannot see, taste or smell lead like, you know, I mean to me, that's very important, because I know from [city], not too long ago, they got a lot of grant money, and they was, they had a company saying they was changing pipes, and really, they never changed the pipes, you know. I mean, so they was collecting the money, but never changed the pipes. So that was telling me that we was getting bad water for a long period of time, until they investigated and found out that they didn't change the water pipe. So it was good to know that, you know, so, but that's a good question. You cannot see or taste or smell, you know? And what I was doing, I was I would before now, when I start saying I would start going back to old school, I would boil the water. I would boil water in the evenings or whatever, in a big pot of water, boil water and and then let it cool. The next day, I would try to drink that type of water, because, like she was saying, sometimes water was very expensive. And then I would come here from time to time and get they filtered water, you know, I mean, but then I, you know, they stopped. They made us once in a while, we couldn't use the same bottle over and over, because, you know, plastic is no good. So that made, you know, man. So then they start, they used to give you four bottles of water. Then they start giving us, like one bottle, you know what I mean, so, but the plastic, you know, I found out, ain't good

Unknown Speaker  12:15  
for us. I love,

Speaker 1  12:16  
I love what you brought up about the issue about people, do do other do I? Do? You all feel like that, like, I really love that. What is what you quoted as, this is not just issue about water. It's issue about people, right? So, can you tell us a little more about that?

Speaker 9  12:33  
Well, I didn't know that until I read that. I didn't know that. So I just read that about the water, you know? And that's not about just the pipes is about the water. I'm trying to figure out, like, what the people had to do with it, like, maybe they put the wrong stuff in the waters, or what?

Speaker 9  13:01  
And also I found out now, from doing surveys and doing different things, I read a lot, so doing a lot of things, I learned that, you know, disposing of medications and everything don't do to go down the toilet, you know, I mean, I didn't know that. And so I really read that. I really never paid that attention. I just came from a phone or stuff. Now I just read a lot of instead of playing games.

Speaker 1  13:26  
Which brings us to the next question we have, right how trust so you see this information, right about water, would you trust this information? You could always do

Unknown Speaker  13:42  
more. Accurate

Speaker 1  13:46  
enough? Can I ask like, what? What makes it sound accurate enough?

Speaker 8  13:50  
Because it sounds like things that I've heard people I'm 38 we've been dealing with less since I was getting tested for lead. A lot of kids my age at that time had lead poisoning from the walls to paint water.

Speaker 1  14:09  
So you already have the historic knowledge. Like background some not enough. Not

Speaker 8  14:18  
enough. You always learn some more. Like I said, permanent solution. Would be to be the best solution. But what is

Speaker 9  14:28  
it? I was reading about they talk about in the older homes, it's definitely more lead in the older homes, because back then, they was putting in the wrong stuff into people's house, and we didn't know any better, like asbestos and things like that nature. We didn't know certain things. That's why I was good, too. When they offered this service, when I come here, sometimes I come here, I was coming just basically for the water. But the reality was, I would look at the I like the place that they had little pamphlets. And that's how, when I picked up the pamphlet, I was able to have them come to the house and do that, you know, I mean, and

Unknown Speaker  15:05  
the pamphlet is just so like,

Speaker 9  15:07  
yeah, the pamphlet was very helpful, because I wouldn't look at the pamphlet told that they had a service. They was asking if you want to, you know, be a part of it, or you needed to just call. And when you call they came out, and what happened today was they did my apartment, and they also did upstairs apartment, but I was trying to bring the owner of the house here today, but she it was CJ port stroke before, so she's getting better now. You know what I mean. So, you know, but it was good information both come, you know? I mean, you know, check both places and it's a newer house. Well, not new, new, but it was 1999 so, you know, I mean, it was a little newer than 100 year old. So I

Speaker 1  15:57  
would have to pick your brains about this also, like we'd love for everyone to join the conversation. Thinking about the information that you're seeing on the pamphlet on this thing, would you trust it or not trust it?

Speaker 8  16:13  
Reinforce and do some other sound.

<moderator-1>  16:24  
Maybe a related question, is anything that you see here, like you also mentioned that something is new, anything that you haven't seen before. We are talking about just

Speaker 8  16:40  
the way you pointed out about people.

Speaker 8  16:50  
Things you do, you just not thinking the apples. I don't flush medicine, but I'm sure plenty of people do and don't think twice

Speaker 1  17:15  
what information we have and what we how we act upon that Information. Not having any information like, yeah, yeah, just curious to hear. Would you? Would you trust this information that you saw?

Speaker 9  17:32  
Yeah, it's good to stay on top of it says, right here. It says a pipe may release lead one day and not the next. So you might have, you might get lead one day, and we're not the next same thing as not seeing the lead or smelling the lead, you know. So it's needed to be checked. The system needed to be checked. The system, some systems like you notice now is a lot of there's a lot of work being done in different towns and different places about replacing the pipes, because they know that the pipes are no good. So you're seeing a lot of stuff. They're going underground, and they redoing the pipes and doing things which is a good thing. So maybe on down the road, other people can, you know, be better off. I No.

Speaker 1  18:24  
Is there any information on here that makes you question things like, I don't really trust it. I would like to know the source where this is coming from, that kind of thing. Actually

Speaker 3  18:47  
would like to add. When they came to my house, they said that it was tested positive, but it was nothing to worry about, because the wall behind the circulator looks like, looks older than what it should be, but a build, it's

Speaker 3  19:16  
nothing to worry about. But I said, I can't let the landlord know.

Unknown Speaker  19:23  
You can't let the

Unknown Speaker  19:25  
landlord know. I can't Okay.

Unknown Speaker  19:41  
Your house did test like you tested.

Speaker 3  19:47  
And I don't have no little ones. My two young grandchildren come over. They don't be in the kitchen now

Speaker 1  19:58  
and and when you test it when, when your house got tested per day and you found out about it, would some information that some information like this would have been helpful, or when you had questions about, like, oh, they came and did the testing, what kind of information would have been helpful for you? Like, what kind of in would some would information like this have been helpful for you at that point of time? Yes, like, what kind of information and in general? Like, I'm curious, like, this is one kind of

Speaker 8  20:32  
information helpful? Because if you're not aware this bringing awareness, I feel like more people should that's the biggest more people should be paying attention to it, right? I agree. A lot of people not, they don't they're drinking water, but more people need to, but I don't know if they care.

Unknown Speaker  20:53  
That's what makes you say that like the care

Unknown Speaker  21:00  
you feel that they don't care, people don't, or more people would be or like people

Unknown Speaker  21:08  
if a tool existed,

Speaker 8  21:10  
if we could do I'm worried about I haven't made it. I'm a human being. I want to be around for

Speaker 3  21:17  
a while. Yeah, we have to be more conscious and more careful.

<moderator-1>  21:23  
So would you say that people don't care? Because it might be, because

Unknown Speaker  21:28  
it's not in their face, like, Yeah, you can't afford to get a multitude of things more people made aware

Speaker 8  21:45  
find a permanent solution. What is the permanent solution? Because it's not filters. It's not cleaning the how do you clean?

Speaker 1  21:54  
Yeah, I love that question that you're asking, right? And I want to be transparent that we won't be able to provide the answers honestly together, but thinking about the awareness aspect is what we are all in together, right? So we really want your feedback on how to present the kind of information, right? Things that I

Unknown Speaker  22:19  
mean, it's presented in a simple way. It's easy to understand. You should be able to understand this. It's not hard to know.

Speaker 1  22:32  
And if you were to act upon this information, would you like after just seeing this about lead in water, just getting this information, if you were to act upon it, how would you act upon it? Or what kind of questions you would ask? Who would you go to? What would you do? In some ways,

Speaker 8  22:53  
because after, after getting the test results from the house visit, I just started buying more water that was

Unknown Speaker  23:02  
my bottled water. And you mentioned

Unknown Speaker  23:05  
how expensive it

Unknown Speaker  23:08  
can get. Sometimes that tastes like

Speaker 8  23:17  
rocks to me, like It tastes the tap water, bottle, the bottled water. That's another thing that somebody has just given us, or we just taken this. Just they say, is this? Do you take it at that? And that's just,

Speaker 9  23:41  
yeah, I love that funny. It's funny. You said that because, by law, a lot of years ago, I read an article about polo spring, and it said it really wasn't polar spring. It was like, you know, there was Avi was saying that it wasn't what it's supposed to It Ain't Poland. It wasn't spring water. You know, what is good? Like you said, you can judge. You don't know.

Speaker 8  24:07  
Honestly, if I'm being honest, book has always been had the reputation of having good water. So yeah, we always have, like a represent, like you can drink

Speaker 9  24:24  
this, I just want but I'm worried that's so true.

<moderator-1>  24:31  
So as part of this project, we just started this year. This is a three year long project. As part of this, we also plan to have test kits being given to homes for making testing much more efficient than it is right now. So that is a longer term goal, which is part of this project as well. I mean, maybe eight to 10 months from now, we will be talking more about what to do, about more data driven. Yeah, this is part of an app that [community-leader] already has access to, but we haven't made it to your because we're still figuring this out, as you can

Speaker 1  25:11  
see, Okay, before we wrap up this paper, I would love to hear if you had any thoughts, because we didn't hear from you at all, so just didn't want to put you on the spot. But like, if you have any thoughts about this, it could be random. Yeah, it could be random thoughts too.

Speaker 3  25:26  
Honestly, she's my daughter. I've been going through that since she's ever been since she's physical. She's always been quiet, and school never spoke up. So she gets shy when she's around a lot of people, and she just stayed quiet. But as I grew up, I'm very talkative.

<moderator-1>  25:49  
Now. I think we all have students who are quite in class, but if we make the environment

Speaker 3  25:56  
right, they open to this day, I still try to get her to talk up when we go places. She wants me to talk for her, because she won't talk up. But yeah, like, speak up.

Speaker 1  26:07  
There is no so I absolutely like, yeah, we gave you a piece of paper, and we are asking you, like, questions about this anyways. But there is no right or wrong answer honestly about this, and we just want to hear, like, what do you thought about this? There are so many things in this paper that I would be like, Oh, this doesn't make sense to me. I don't understand this fully,

Speaker 8  26:24  
if you have some kind of understanding already, because, you know, when they even before they did the testing, when they but when they came and did the tested, they also the kids. And, you know, they discussed with us the results and what that means, and they broke it down. So if you didn't know, they kind of got the awareness right there. Okay, so that was your first source. Should we move

Unknown Speaker  26:49  
on to the second one? Yes. So we can take these. We can actually,

Speaker 1  26:59  
yeah, if you want, if you want to keep them, yeah, this is the lead. Okay, yeah, you could actually hold on to it.

Unknown Speaker  27:13  
So the second sheet is

Speaker 1  27:20  
okay, so you saw the first one. What we're really trying to understand is this is a lot of information, right? How do we communicate it to people? So, related to related to what you mentioned, awareness is a big issue. If you want to bring create awareness, we also have to speak in a way that is Thank you. That meets people where they are right in some way,

Speaker 8  27:44  
very short form, very small,

Speaker 1  27:50  
exactly, right? So thinking about like, this is the same info, like, we have some information about lead, but the first one was in a different in a different way, the second one is in a slightly different so it's the same.

<moderator-1>  28:01  
Content is the same. But the way we are telling you this, we won't tell you, tell you how that is different, because that's we are kind of experimenting with. But we want to see how you react.

Speaker 1  28:16  
How do you feel about it, and how again, like, how do you think others would feel about this, in some way when they've seen this

Unknown Speaker  28:21  
kind of does it even make a difference?

Speaker 1  28:30  
Thank you. We would love for you to also if you could join us, we'd love to hear your inputs. I it. I think your perspective is equally important. Like you have you have so much experience, like we don't know a lot. Like all of you have so much experience. We want to learn from you. So please do it. Did you have you given? So this is the did you get? Oh, it's there the two sheets. So again, to recap what I just said. So it is kind of similar information, but in a slightly different tonality. What we really want to understand is like, if you want to create that awareness among people, like, Hey, this is an important matter. We also need to do it in the right place. So we want to learn from you what is working and what might not work, right. So these are the two variations we are showing. So the second, if you have any feedback on what is what kind of language is better versus not, or what kind of messaging is better, what kind of visuals

Unknown Speaker  29:42  
are better. How often have you or

Speaker 1  30:00  
often, actually, could you read through that? If possible? Could you read through that like we would love to, because the language matters, like what we want to present and what we actually want to get your feedback?

Unknown Speaker  30:16  
I like this one better the way this one is better

Unknown Speaker  30:22  
than this

Speaker 1  30:24  
one, yes, the one you read now, yeah,

Speaker 8  30:27  
the part where it says the letter has no taste and that it literally tells you you can check your utility bill to find out if you want a public pipeline, and it's

Unknown Speaker  30:38  
what about that Picture? You

Speaker 8  30:40  
feel like that's more information than was here, like some of that was here, but not all of that more more detail, because it says the burden falls on you here, but it don't go into specifics how and where. This tells you exactly where you need to look to know what you need to know.

Unknown Speaker  31:01  
What language is that

Unknown Speaker  31:03  
that is here, if you use A private well, that's not As specific one as yourself.

Unknown Speaker  32:00  
Action. Let's Go the other

Speaker 2  32:21  
way. Yeah, Thank you. Well,

Speaker 8  33:14  
said they can't confirm that it's safe. They can confirm that it's unsafe. Sorry, go ahead. Over. Sorry. They can't confirm that your water is safe today, but they can confirm that

Unknown Speaker  33:34  
it's not safe. That's the public unfold. Sorry. What was the information in again,

Speaker 8  33:43  
it said that they can't confirm that your water is safe, just from a test.

Unknown Speaker  33:50  
So What question did that drink?

Speaker 8  33:52  
They can confirm that it's not safe. Though, from the test, I see

Speaker 1  33:57  
the question that it got it, that it read, is

Unknown Speaker  34:01  
certainly confirmed that it's not safe. Goes in and out. Some days it's there, some days it's not, yeah, other questions that come to your mind,

Speaker 1  34:20  
as well as insurance, come

Speaker 9  34:25  
to your mind as well. I don't know this one is talked about. It's real important for families with young children or people who are pregnant. So it's very important too for them, for the younger people, you know to know it. You know. They take it in their bodies and they talking about, you know, like knowing the older houses, those are ones that more that needs to work, not not saying the other ones don't. But the older houses, with houses have been around for maybe 100 years or so, whatever the case may be. Never had pipes changed. Never had things changed. You know, those are the ones usually should be targeted, you know. I mean, like to really check and look into because and they know, and they know that when they come out and inspect, yeah, they can pretty much look at the house and see which ones is older than other ones. And, you know, they some, if they go to places they see asbestos and different things and houses that more newer houses don't even have. They didn't put that. They put them in the older houses, you know. And people wasn't aware of a lot of that, right?

Speaker 1  35:36  
So what I'm hearing is like, when you're thinking about what action should be taken you're thinking about like maybe they should target the older houses first and check if the water check about the water

Speaker 9  35:51  
quality. My house might have it. The next house might not have it. My house might have it. The next one go. New ones is the better ones. Old pipes is running for so long, and all this stuff start anything don't last forever. So particles start getting into the water, start going through some stuff.

Speaker 1  36:21  
Do you do happen? Do you get any other questions in mind as we went through

Speaker 8  36:26  
this, as far as this, the way the information is being delivered, maybe video format would be better for some people, because it could be. It's not bad for me, but it could be information overload for somebody else, yeah.

Speaker 1  36:43  
Just curious, if you had access to a portal that gave you this kind of information, would you use it? Yes. And would you trust? How about trust?

Speaker 9  36:58  
There's good information always to know, like some things I learned today by just coming here, like you can't smell it, you can't see it, you know, things in that nature, you know, I already figured out maybe it's in the older houses. That's where the land really is, you know. But it's still always good to get information. It's always good to get knowledge of things that's going on, you know, and maybe make some changes. Have people make changes. Have the city makes some changes and better the community. They used to always say, though [city] had the best way. And back then, you know, you know more back then we was drinking down the tap. And as time went on, we start changing that, you know, I would say about 30 years for me, you know, I mean, by 30 years we was drinking out of you know, we were just drinking water. Wasn't a family last 10 years,

Speaker 8  38:10  
gallon or like the jug that goes in the fridge or the polar spring fountain, but not just bottom of water.

Speaker 9  38:21  
We were just drinking water. It wasn't affecting nothing. But then they start talking about the water. You got to check the water. You got to check the lead, and, you know, the paint and all this kind of stuff from lead. And you had to, you know, come in, have people check with the kids. When was

Speaker 1  38:39  
the first time you all started noticing these concerns with water? Or when was the first time it actually happened?

Speaker 8  38:46  
I feel like the first time I was, like, alarmed about it was when it hit the school, when it hit the school and they, like, shut down the waterfalls and everything before they got the filter. What if I would say that was, was it after the pandemic? I don't remember it was, it was before the pandemic. It had, yeah, but they started, like, covering the water problems with plastic so the kids couldn't drink out of it until they got the filter ones. Yeah, we have the same and they was giving them bottles, supplying them with bottles of water. That's when it really got serious. Like, because before it wasn't, it didn't seem like,

Speaker 1  39:29  
yeah, so between the two versions that you saw, what are your thoughts about the language? The bit particularly about the language used?

Speaker 8  39:38  
I feel like the language is simpler on the first one, but it's more information. On the second one, it's the same information, but it feels like more

Speaker 9  39:51  
detailed both of them was helpful for me, but it was good to always look at a different point of view. It was always good to look at one way and then see it another way, because I might see it different than she does, you know? I mean, so it was good to have both, you know, to get a stay open minded for me.

Speaker 1  40:10  
So again, like, for some context, the reason we are asking is we may present in one tonality versus another, right? There's a lot of information. So thinking about like, which one which aspects of presentation, presenting this information in both these both of these cases you liked or you did not like. Think about what you did not like. That's something I always want to hear.

Speaker 8  40:36  
Things you do. I would say that first, it was really nothing I didn't like. But I will say that keep it like both, keep both ways, because people, multiple people, receive information different, like comprehend different, or like their understanding, or maybe even a verbiage is not up there, so the simpler way would be better for them. And then you have people who do understand with the more detailed and yeah, so I feel like Both ways are good and it will benefit different people for

Speaker 9  41:18  
different the way I saw it. I like both, you know, it was more maybe detailed, maybe in the second one, it was more information that I didn't see in the first one, you know. I mean, so I saw in the second one, you know, like I talked about the aging of the house and, you know, the other little stuff that I mentioned, you know. So your neighbor's water can be different from the next door neighbor, you know, I might have overlooked it in the first but I didn't see it, so I supported the second. So, you know,

Speaker 1  41:47  
again, yeah, how we present the information matters? Yeah, yes.

Speaker 9  41:53  
It's always good to know and stay up on some things. You know, it's always same to know you read up on some things and like to help the next generation to me, you know, I mean to help the other people that's coming along now, the younger kids and all the other stuff, the pregnant women. You know, you can, you know, we can make some changes. Hasn't been no changes in North for a long period of time. The water issue for so long, the lead issue for so long,

Speaker 8  42:15  
and it has this information on as we find out about it. It's not

Speaker 3  42:20  
information on as we find out about it, but I have one question, when you drink the water, why does it have a funny taste to it?

Speaker 8  42:30  
I don't drink I don't drink warm room.

Speaker 3  42:37  
I don't either ice cold to drink it. I drink it warm. It just don't taste right

Speaker 8  42:45  
to me. It's sometimes it could be, again, the pipe. Sometimes it smell like bleach to me. So they got like a chlorine smell to, I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  43:01  
over here,

Speaker 3  43:08  
check the pipes, they said they had to check the pipes. They never gave me no information about anything, because I had just moved in over here. I came from this side to go over my house. Over here. I was on by Clinton Avenue, and I moved back over here. I used to live over here, back over here, because I'm not home. It wasn't the city. I'm not sure who was, because I'm still learning [city] from New York, and I've been out here only seven years, because my grandson is seven, and he's our only baby that he had out here. So he's a jersey baby. He was born in [city] in University Hospital. Yeah, so I'm still learning, but it's good to know all this information. Do

Speaker 1  44:05  
you all have any concluding, any last thought, any thoughts about this piece of like, if information like this was presented,

Unknown Speaker  44:13  
would it be like it was presented? Well,

Unknown Speaker  44:18  
would something like this be useful?

Speaker 8  44:20  
Yes, if you read, yes, if you actually read or taken information, it's very useful.

Speaker 1  44:25  
Yes. Can I ask this question? Do you think people would read it if something like this, like in this age of information, has so much,

Unknown Speaker  44:33  
it really depends on the person. It varies from person person.

Speaker 5  44:42  
Do you have any suggestions or advice for us how to get people

Speaker 8  44:47  
that don't read to read? I don't know. Like how to incentivize people to read? I like to read so, you know, I don't need a reward to read.

<moderator-1>  45:00  
One of the things we're also actively working on is, like <moderator-2> mentioned the presentation part. One of the aspects is how to mix long bodies of text with like video, figures, charts,

Speaker 8  45:14  
videos, eventually videos, somebody speaking it, but they still needed

Speaker 1  45:26  
so we had a few any other questions. In general, let's say we have a tool where you can access information like this about water quality, local water quality, right? What are some things that would be really important for you personally, if there is a website on an app where you can go and access information about New York's water quality, right, what would be important for you personally,

Speaker 8  46:01  
how long it's been bad, what can you do to avoid it? I'm trying to what else, pretty much, all this implementing and what you can do to avoid it. How long it's been bad, you know? What are we doing

Unknown Speaker  46:16  
about it? Yeah, what steps you taking, or where you can go

Speaker 8  46:23  
to to, you know, like, be a part of something, or like, get into to try to help something,

Unknown Speaker  46:29  
something, information could be forward to friends and family

Unknown Speaker  46:34  
to share with others. Yeah?

Unknown Speaker  46:36  
Information forwarding for friends. Yeah. I

Speaker 1  46:44  
and a few other questions, like, if you presenting this information right again on a website or on a portal, on an app, something like that, who should be responsible for it, for the quality of information, right? That this information is accurate, that this information

Speaker 8  47:05  
is cutting multiple people should be in charge of outsourcing the information, double checking, making sure everything is accurate, making sure everything is what it says it is. Yeah, multiple people, and I feel like definitely social media, because everybody's on social media, so this format, but slides on Instagram or Tiktok, whatever everybody

Speaker 5  47:31  
would you trust any social like any person

Speaker 8  47:35  
would I mean that people believe whatever they see so but If you putting out actual, accurate information in a tantalizing way that's capturing people's attention, you would engage with it.

Speaker 1  47:53  
So there are some sources. The other question was like, the other question was like, how do you think people of [city], New York, should be involved in this process? If we have a portal or website like this far can make water quality,

Speaker 8  48:10  
people should volunteer. Figure out how they how you get in, where you fit it, and then figure out what you can do to be a help to where you live.

Speaker 9  48:19  
Come to things like this. When you're promoting something and trying to give them some knowledge, they got to be willing. They got to come out and get involved, check it, get involved and see what's going on. Sometimes people don't even care about what's really going on. If somebody just start coming out, that comes out, and bring the information back, or try to make some changes in the household, it's always good to come to presentations. That's what I do. I come here to get some water, whatever. When I did was coming, but then I didn't come as much because they were only given the one bottle of water. I told you about that plastic, read about the plastic they want you to recycle and bring keeping the same bottle. And I know that don't that wasn't good, and

Speaker 1  49:21  
any other things that you think we might like when we are providing information about water quality on such a website or app, other things that we might have missed that you think would be really important for residents

Speaker 8  49:42  
of it everything else for like, common sense. I know that's not a good way to think, because everybody don't think. For me, it's like, This is common sense.

Speaker 8  50:02  
But more of this, more of this information, good information. So yeah, the problem, where we at the solution, and what people can do to join in and help, and all that good stuff. More people

Speaker 1  50:23  
what people can do to join to help. Are you thinking of like, some actionable things that people can do? Like, could the focus suggest quality of groups that they would want to be involved in, things like that,

Speaker 8  50:37  
or sharing the app suggests, yeah. One of the things that you can suggestions for groups to join, or places to volunteer, or, yeah, where to get well, the information should be on now, where to go, where to make change, and

Speaker 8  51:02  
is it like? It like, supposed to be like, kid friendly? Like, I'm sorry, is this supposed to be like, kid friendly too? Like, maybe quizzes or something, like, some type of, like, I don't know, like, some type of Q, A, so the kids can understand what's happening. Something like, you know, like you read something like this, and then you what did you learn? Like, like, what like, how we do it, but in app form, what did you learn?

Speaker 1  51:31  
Like for kids, yes, to keep them engaged, yeah, and learn also at the same time, my last question was about, like, trust in some way, because in this age of information we are living, we have so much information. Yes, right. How do we trust? What information is

Unknown Speaker  51:49  
like? Social media, right? You see.

Speaker 1  51:52  
So, what are your thoughts about how we present information and what would make it more trustworthy for you?

Unknown Speaker  52:01  
It could be very personal. Basically, I don't

Speaker 9  52:19  
know you can Google anything. Tell me something I can do.

Speaker 8  52:22  
Where do you think

Unknown Speaker  52:30  
this information might be coming from? What would be the source of this?

Speaker 9  52:41  
We did not make sure. What do you think? You can probably Google anything today, mainly, you know, I mean, but it's gonna pop up. That's one thing that's good about technology. Technology, you can put you got it in the palm of the edge. It could make you a break. You know, I mean, you can, you can. You can do negative things as well as good things. Is what you searching for, and what did you looking for?

Speaker 8  53:19  
This is over that you got to check, double check and triple check, because it's so much garbage, along with the facts

Speaker 1  53:30  
and information could be from social media. It could be something coming from [community-leader], you know, for years,

Unknown Speaker  53:35  
right, something somebody may not, or coming

Speaker 1  53:38  
from a government agency, right? Thinking about like there could be so many different sources of information, right? And some way, social media to someone you know, [community-leader], you have met in person, versus a government website, right? Some of those stuff like that, right? So thinking about, how would you associate trust with each of the

Speaker 8  54:00  
now, I don't know. Now, I'm questioning it, because I came with the assumption that the information came from here. Yes, it didn't. So no, it's accurate. I feel like it's accurate still, but now,

<moderator-1>  54:14  
yeah, so it not only came from trusted sources, but we worked together with [community-leader] vetted this before, of course, but

Speaker 1  54:26  
also, I'm curious to hear about your thoughts now we gave you the answer, like, where this is coming from.

Speaker 8  54:30  
Again, I could always go research each thing and find out.

<moderator-1>  54:38  
So I think what <moderator-2> is getting at is, let's say we don't tell you where the information came from. Would you still trust it, knowing that it comes from a government agency like EPA or somewhere else? Would you still treat it the same way you have treated this information?

Speaker 1  55:00  
Would you treat it the same way as you treat the information coming from [community-leader]?

Speaker 8  55:07  
I trust him. I trust this place. But again, you talk about government agencies and a grain of salt,

Speaker 8  55:19  
or even the government wanting to look one way and it's a different way, or wanting to look a little cleaner than it is, or just trying to make it neat and cute, or package it a certain way. So yeah, with a grain of salt, but like I said from here, I trusted the information. I want down,

Unknown Speaker  55:36  
down question, yes, but, but that's why we're trying.

Speaker 8  55:40  
I feel like they're good actually doing the footwork, actually out here in the field, doing the footwork, with the cleaning the water, to talking to people, to test all of it. Yeah. So I trust.

Speaker 1  55:51  
I really like that fact that you're bringing up, right, trusting, because you have that relationship with them, right? But when you're bringing this to an online website, and this app is giving you this information. How would you feel about that dress like someone seeing this information versus an app giving back? What would you like to know to be able to like resources, resources, direct sources. Where is

Speaker 8  56:19  
it coming from? Who is it coming to? When you write a paper in school and you have to write all your sources down, you can check it,

Speaker 9  56:33  
reference it presented yourself coming from the schools, that's telling me that you're researching, that's telling me that you're getting knowledge, and you want to know our aspect of what we think about the situation, right off the back, when you say who you were and where you was coming from, you wasn't coming off the street, coming from the school. And you got to oversee it. That's overseeing your students. And someone's telling me that you're doing some type of research, some positive things you want to know, like what's going on and how we can make things better. And it was funny, you said that about the city and the government, because I actually wrote that down on one of your questions. And I was going to mention that city and the government when you said something about who they would like the sources, but then I thought about the city, the city was crooked, right when they were saying that they was doing the pipes and they weren't doing the pipes, and then the government all the stuff going on. So, you know, like, Who do you trust or you trust? But everybody's not crooked. Everybody's not missing, you know? I mean, so it's always, for me, you got to look at the source of where things is coming from to even give me a thought, to see if I'm listening to your entertainment, you know. I mean, if you from the streets are coming from, not saying that you're buying it, but when you come into school, that's telling me that you're looking into things, you know. I mean, you reading on some stuff, you know, you know, you looking things up and trying to see how we can do things better.

<moderator-1>  58:07  
That's a good thing. And you mentioned Instagram and Tiktok, right? So imagine you see a Tiktok video now where someone looks like [community-leader], because it's actually not [community-leader], some AI version. Would you trust them? No, what

Speaker 1  58:23  
if you saw a video of someone from New York posting about their water quality and like sharing pictures of the dirty like the brown water? How would you react to that?

Unknown Speaker  58:33  
I mean, I will believe it, because I've seen it for

Speaker 9  58:42  
myself. From my own eyes. Sometimes you get phone calls people say we're working on the water, let the water run for a certain amount of time. But this was a

Speaker 1  59:01  
wonderful discussion, and I really love your points about coming from. Where is it coming from, right? This is important, and

<moderator-1>  59:11  
hopefully a year from now, we will produce that video which will make you trust that video.

Speaker 1  59:15  
Enough. Do you want to add any thoughts about trust associated with information?

Unknown Speaker  59:37  
Yes, okay, yes, we can stop the recording. Here, I don't know.
