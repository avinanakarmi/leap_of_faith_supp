Okay, yeah, so I think my Do you have any questions for us before we get started?

Speaker 2  1:29  
Yeah, in that case, we can. We would love to hear your thoughts on how this information is. You can pass it along, yeah, how this information about water quality is presented here, and you can be critical about it, right? Like you can tell us your thoughts, like things that work, things are confusing, that you don't trust. You don't trust at all, anything like that.

Unknown Speaker  1:59

Speaker 5  7:30  
You, 28 years and never came in to drive. She was

Speaker 4  7:49

Unknown Speaker  8:49  
He has a razor.

Downstairs, checked upstairs.

Unknown Speaker  9:55  
We love another day. We're happy to i.

Unknown Speaker  10:05  
With some attention. See You. Maybe

Unknown Speaker  10:42  
that's your of time. In the best interest of time read it. I just wanted to call that, you know, see if you can

Speaker 7  11:14  
because my power A

Unknown Speaker  11:27  
minute, and then we can start talking About so

Unknown Speaker  12:01  
did you all get a chance to read through this? I did.

Speaker 7  12:12  
Yes. Any thoughts? First thoughts.

Speaker 1  12:21  
Listen. Here says that there's no lead in the 24 to 25 graph. Is that certain? That's the data we got from

Unknown Speaker  12:42  
gravity. Exactly,

Speaker 1  12:50  
the [state], so status, meaning the website, a

Unknown Speaker  12:59  
what made you question? What made you question that this because

Speaker 1  13:09  
when they went to my house, they said that there was a little lead in the water.

Speaker 2  13:16  
And now that you heard that this is coming from the [org]. How do you feel about this chart, this data,

Speaker 1  13:29  
Vienna, the gobierno, the [state] del Estado e Service came to Aguas. Okay.

Speaker 3  13:52  
You can see in the most recent years, it shows there's almost no lead in the water. It's very little down here. And she was skeptical about that, and once we let her know where we got the data from, she feels like the government or the department's lied to her, because

Speaker 1  14:17  
when she did the testing her home, they found small traces of lead in her water. Okay, so she's saying, How is there lead in my water? But within the state graph, they're saying there's no

Unknown Speaker  14:27  
lead. Based on all of

Speaker 2  14:33  
your lived experiences, based on all of your lived experiences. Do you have any other thoughts about this

Unknown Speaker  14:47  
experience? Yes.

Unknown Speaker  15:00  
What do you think? What do you think about when they talk

Speaker 5  15:07  
about lead? I think most of the time when I'm getting information, even on the radio or something like that, I'm just glad that they they care, especially with the young people, because they don't coming into the school all them trying to get water and stuff from the same fountain and stuff. That's nasty.

Speaker 4  15:32  
Yeah, that's a good point. Good job. Good job. Yes, I'm wanting to share that information.

Speaker 2  15:42  
Oh, thinking about this information that you saw on these on this paper, would you trust it? I don't

Speaker 5  16:07  
I trust information, but I just maybe made a known about it makes me feel like I can't trust them. Who's there? Uh, this company, I wouldn't be able to trust them like, okay, when I come out for my [org] they come so they can't really tell me nothing. If they don't have to pack the pipes, right, they, you know, they'll be making up things. No. So I believe them. I'd rather call the company itself and find out what's going on.

Speaker 1  16:49  
So you think if you were to call the company and hear it from somebody, some actual person, you would trust it more

Speaker 5  16:59  
a little bit. What I would like, if there's, if there are any changes, then I would rather take the time to be long even give you to do a card or a conversation. That's, you know, because we got the little kids that don't really know what's going on, and they don't know they just put in their mouths and stuff like that

Speaker 1  17:24  
conversation or a letter at home would be something you would trust

Speaker 5  17:29  
that way I have, I have back back up, if I had to review something or someone came to me and I told them, maybe the wrong throwing the right thing. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  17:43  
How about others? What about trusting this information?

Speaker 8  17:59  
Or they might then

Speaker 2  18:05  
right or wrong answer, basically, how you feel about it honestly. We want to hear

Unknown Speaker  18:12  
that when I requested so. Let's

Unknown Speaker  18:19  
Los Angeles.

Speaker 4  18:52  
And I think she made a good point about that water and like, and remember, we was talking about that earlier, about how we noticed something was going wrong, water in the park, so they stopped the water in the schools, so they shut that off. And I was glad to hear her say that, you know, acknowledge that you know what I mean, like, you know, drinking water after the people in the fountains, and once they start cutting the water off in the parks, it was like opening people's eyes and let them see something's got to be wrong and stuff in the water. She always like, you know, she always, she always like bottled water. That's what she know, man, she likes bottled water, corporate lifestyle. So, you know, she likes that type of

Speaker 1  19:42  
is it because you are more, you trust more that it, that it's a that it's clean

Speaker 4  19:50  
water, yeah, what she do like for me, when we, when I, when I take her to Costcos, I buy, I buy the Costco brand. But to her, she'll buy. The Polo. And I try to tell her, Look, maybe that's too much. I don't know, you know, because sometime I read before, like I was telling you, I read about a couple of years years ago, about Polo. Wasn't all Polo. I don't know what the trust is. You know what? I mean, she wants to pay the higher prices. Just get the Kirk.

Speaker 5  20:22  
Get the cut if you but you can actually taste if you put, let's say, two pearls, one, hopefully from Crystal. Or you could taste the difference, because you already have minerals and stuff in your body. So that's my knock it from one way. So you could, you could still taste. You could taste it, you know, something is wrong. And then when you walk it up to to any of the fountains, and either there's no one really over there, or they have the tape and stuff around that that's that's even worse.

Speaker 6  21:00  
Yeah, they did that at our university too,

Unknown Speaker  21:05  
exactly, yeah. But

Speaker 2  21:09  
thinking about like you're seeing, you're seeing this happen in life, right? You're seeing this water fountains or water like because of lead issue, they are being closed at that point of time. If you had information like this.

Speaker 1  21:28  
We don't get lost.

Unknown Speaker  21:35  
Escuela, see it

Speaker 7  21:39  
was this time When I keep going.

Unknown Speaker  21:40  
Says one

Speaker 9  22:02  
God. Informal, public a hospital

Speaker 1  22:12  
in pesar on a pencil pas, person, antes de que se mandaron los abisos, consistamos pension pensando neces Sabino case.

Unknown Speaker  22:31  
Also, information is a lot closer you have see Syria. And you

Unknown Speaker  22:49  
that was he confused

Unknown Speaker  22:57  
Vienna key or publica.

Speaker 1  23:02  
You asked if they explained it explained well or just it's explained.

Speaker 2  23:11  
Would you trust this information, like or like, what aspects of this language, what it is written, how it is explained, or the visual, all of that? Would you trust it? Or are there things that we rank questions to you? Like, I don't think I don't really see that. Like, who is giving me this information?

Speaker 5  23:30  
Well, I think for me, it's different because I have in my own home machine, water always sterile, so I don't have to have that problem. But if, sometimes when, and especially with cooking, because you have to be more, got kids. One thing, you have kids, then now you gotta worry about the kitchen, trying to get everything as well. But I we used to when we were younger. My mother used to say, what she was telling me to take the water and clean it. I'm like, How'd you with water? And it's already, they already have it purified, I thought, but they're saying that they're not. So that's why we don't before you put, you know, it in your food and things like that. You're supposed to boil the water. No, it's too much.

Unknown Speaker  24:32  
Boiling water doesn't get rid of lead. It makes it worse, because the heat does something to like

Speaker 4  24:46  
particles, and it becomes a higher. Last class I was talking about from old school, I thought that morning to take out everything See what I'm saying. But it's, don't, you know? So you learn some. That when you boil something, it'll be purified. Anything was the heat head out there, until you said that, like, you know, like you can boil it, but that ain't gonna take out the lead. I didn't know that. Remember, earlier today I was like, boiling that it would pull out, boil water and sitting on the stove, and next day, you know, thought it was better that way. If I didn't have bottled

Speaker 1  25:23  
water, it does kill bacteria, right, right? So things like that will leave the water, right. But things like lead, which is a metal, it won't evaporate away, right? It'll stay. And the heat of it actually makes it even higher concentration. So that's why, yeah, whenever you use water from your faucet, always use a cold water, as opposed to hot. If you're gonna drink or boil, hot water goes through the pipes, and if you have bad pipes, not saying you do right, just in general, and the hot water from those pipes makes the lead on in the pipe leach out. Let your water run and

Speaker 10  26:11  
use it cold.

Unknown Speaker  26:20  
Solo saka bacteria is must concentration, so what they're

Unknown Speaker  26:42  
hearing is like, how information is power,

Unknown Speaker  26:44  
right? Like, like you described,

Speaker 2  26:46  
right, knowing that no hot water if you, even if you boil the water, let it not go away. So information is power, but how do we convey that information right, in the right way? How do we reach people in the right way? What should we say so, and what makes an information trustworthy versus not trustworthy?

Speaker 1  27:07  
SK la information says he pero como uno receiver information como lo confia. Si uno confianesso, como podamos cambiar esto paque uno puede mejora of entender mass, fuzzy, must rap you, though, is that information case being important?

Speaker 2  27:31  
And that's what we want to understand, which is why we want your feedback on. Like these are, I know like, these are paper, like, long text, right stuff, but we really want your feedback on essentially, like the language that is being used, what is confusing, what what you trust, what you don't trust, what aspects make you trust versus not trusted? If you can share, if everyone will share, the thoughts, see, I know

Speaker 5  27:57  
for myself. First. Time, we all have our habits, our first habits, we don't want to change. I'm so used to doing things way, that way, but they need to. They need especially for the younger you want to have some type of, some type of chart or something that

Speaker 2  28:29  
they can understand for the younger generation charts. I love that what you brought up charts for young why not? Why younger generation?

Speaker 5  28:42  
Because they are the ones that really that is, is using, they're one of this, using the water product and stuff. Because most of the adults you out trying to get work, or you at work, so they had time to be thinking about water all the time.

Speaker 2  29:02  
So what if you were to get this kind of information? What would you prefer, personally? So for younger people, said that maybe chance or something like that. Personally for you, what would you

Speaker 5  29:16  
prefer? I'm good with just receiving it at my house, because I have, I've been that's all I've been drinking, and it's they, they use the water at, like the hospitals and stuff like that. So that makes me feel sure that.

Speaker 2  29:39  
But I love the point that you brought up chats for younger people. I'm gonna we'll come back to it if we have some time. In the meantime, we'd love to hear from everyone about like thoughts, about trust, what aspects make you trust this information or even not trust this and you can be brutal. It.

Speaker 2  30:05  
And you already brought up right the graph. Graph did not note like the chart did not note that you're and you found lead in your house, but the chart did not that something

Unknown Speaker  30:22  
like that, she come out in Contrast.

Unknown Speaker  30:28  
No, reflect, also experience, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  30:51  
arrows. Let's get it.

Speaker 5  31:12  
Now what I really think about the young people, like we would play so tired, you'll be thirsty, so you will go in the house. But the kids today, they have too many sodas, all that sweet stuff, so they're not getting the same ingredient that We got. I know for myself,

Unknown Speaker  31:46  
star, I'm sorry. I

Unknown Speaker  32:16  
to focus you,

Speaker 1  32:35  
she said was on the first page back here, she circled this front part and said that she has heard of lead, but had no I really idea or any background about it. She led. She read here, and she said that it was really clear, and she's learning. She just learned a lot more what it's about. Yeah, and then on the back, she also saw the graph, and she said that when they did the test of her house, it did come up positive, but that was in the paint. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  33:20  
Did it

Speaker 2  33:28  
raise so reading this now that you did not know about lead as much reading this, did it raise new questions for you that you are now more curious About and you would want

Unknown Speaker  33:48  
to Know More, See to

Unknown Speaker  34:08  
establish the

Speaker 1  34:20  
get also looking at this image here and seeing the parts that it looks like you need to replace a lot of tubes so that they don't wear away and leach lid. I said, Yes, yeah, that's what the image shows. LED let us discuss also that I asked her if she read the small letterings, or if it was just too small. She said, No, I read it.

Speaker 2  34:56  
And does she trust it? All of this information. Ask.

Speaker 5  35:12  
It makes me old to so now I'm like, wow, I think about I'm quickly, just keep throwing water, but you need to hold on to it, because sometimes what happens to be having, they have some issues with the word we might be in

Unknown Speaker  35:46  
bad trouble. That's why it was good for them to come test. It was good for them to contest.

Speaker 2  36:00  
What was the what? Sorry, would you? Would she trust it? Sorry? Do you remember she said yes, because

Speaker 1  36:10  
for her, it makes sense that that old tubes and old pipes would be harmful

Speaker 2  36:18  
to somebody. No. You just curious to hear from all of you while she is giving us another sheet. Where do you think this information might be coming from? The

Speaker 9  36:38  
que Instituto or the Que group they don't like?

Unknown Speaker  37:02  
Pensamiento.

Speaker 3  37:13  
Would you trust them? No, they also the same institution. That. It was the affairs, the content, the numbers, one

Unknown Speaker  37:38  
day came out.

Unknown Speaker  37:42  
No, no. One of

Speaker 8  37:45  
our classmates came out to make

Unknown Speaker  38:01  
sure it's right. No, yeah,

Speaker 7  38:17  
and this is so a different tone which connects with people. So this one has one

Speaker 2  38:40  
tone. So which resonates and how you feel about it again, no, no right or wrong.

Speaker 3  38:49  
Like, which idea of having these messages is to raise awareness, to get them to know more about what's happening and to get them to care about and act upon it. So big part of that is how we convey the message, how we spell it out, how we explain

Unknown Speaker  39:11  
it. Queremos.

Speaker 8  39:24  
You, does this

Speaker 3  39:34  
information act on it? So we have a different variant of the message written out differently, the same content, but it's just explained in a different tone or different style. So we'd like you to take a look at this and let us know what you find different.

Unknown Speaker  40:06  
Opinion, we can talk you trust it better, if it helps you understand better.

Speaker 9  40:11  
See confias madness, okay, I was just laughing

Speaker 5  40:19  
because No, okay. I was just laughing, because, since I'm not doing well, because I had stroke, and one of my girlfriends, she started, I was like. She was like, Do you ever get Yes, you said, Well, you know to make sure you you do know right with the water, and

Unknown Speaker  40:44  
sure enough, when I looked up at my mail, I swear

Speaker 5  40:47  
I said, Oh, guess what. You talked it up. What did she say again? She was asking me, did I have a moment to talk to you? Because she said they hadn't stopped. They're walking. People were walking around and talking about it, trying to get us noticed, to notice what's happening with the water. And I was saying what, you know, and it's just funny, because I came home and then I see a letter.

Unknown Speaker  41:20  
That letter, what was in that letter? It may feel

Unknown Speaker  41:37  
that whoever it is and do, make this good because

Unknown Speaker  41:49  
you're keeping more for others. So I really like, I like sweets and sodas. What

Speaker 4  42:17  
appears like this is a little different than the first one I made today. I noticed that. So, you know, my assumption said, would be seeing the same thing. But see, you never know. You can't assume anything, right? So I'm seeing the rules when they say, like, you know, like where the health standards and the baby the health might say some standards, and the government might say another standards, like me, standard, it's different views and opinions. So it's just some information. We ask any person

Speaker 2  42:50  
who's receiving all this information, the health saying something different the government. How does that make you feel? Make me feel sometimes, confused. Information

Speaker 4  43:13  
is comfortable. She made a good point talking about the health department, the city government. You know, it's a lot of burdens of people like, you know, but what I do, like is I'm starting to acknowledge and knowing that they're doing destruction. I'm seeing it with my own eyes. They taking out the pipes, which they didn't do in 2019 that they said they did, and they got paid for, but they didn't do that, which they what they stated on here. And I didn't see that when I on the paper, but when I read off the tablet, I saw that they know about that in 2019 and they didn't do anything about it on it, but they said they did. So sometimes we just can't believe what you hear. People can tell you that they're doing it, but you actually got to see it like now you see not just in North I'm seeing it in other towns as well, and it's like a lot of old blocks, but I see they digging, taking out old powers and old things, which is a good thing, like she's standing because it's better for the younger generation and other kids and other people to make it better, like so people are starting to notice. So had to be somebody starting to report things or say certain things, and now they're starting to look into starting to do something about that's what they need to do something about when you say they who are responsible.

Speaker 4  44:57  
They got, I believe they got the testers. Really test the water. I believe they know basically what's going on, you know, like for us, you know, like what's happening. But they would tell us some other stuff to keep it at bay, but to see it now, they take an action and prompt their minute in 2019 about it, taking action, right? If

Unknown Speaker  45:29  
you're getting this information, what kind

Speaker 4  45:35  
of action could you I would start coming to more things in like this, reading what I like to read a lot anyway. So I like to read a lot of information and stuff with different things and who I'm getting the information from. Because a lot of times it can be like, they say, fake mood, they can be fake stuff. And listen to you guys. I know that you came from a college, so that's telling me that you're reading something in college. You're studying some things. You're studying about what's going on. So, you know, I stay open to that, because I know you're looking into things. I love that. I love that.

Speaker 2  46:17  
Mark, you brought that up again. I want to touch base here. Actually, yes, maybe if, if you could also read through both the versions and tell us, like, give some feedback on which version you like personally better. It's very similar information in both. But we want to get your feedback so that, if we are building a tool, we learn like which message is complete.

Unknown Speaker  46:47  
Both of them is knowledgeable. To me, the way you perceive it, some people might perceive, and I might have, from the First version, I might have overlooked something. People the way,

Unknown Speaker  47:28  
is here different way to view? Yeah,

Speaker 4  47:57  
it the first page of the second page. What do you think is best?

Speaker 5  48:00  
Put me where I need to know I wasn't really standing because if I'm not in the field. But after I heard him talking,

Speaker 5  48:22  
and I thought about me, and I thought about and if I get a Big Bill, and

Unknown Speaker  48:40  
I come down, I come down. I

Speaker 8  48:48  
come down any thoughts on which one de las vahinas

Speaker 4  49:01  
But they were saying the same thing In the beginning. It's almost the same thing because maybe

Speaker 2  49:30  
a little bit more about trusting this information, right? Because what you brought up is very important. The city is saying the health department is not there.

Speaker 3  49:47  
Opinion. What do you think about the information itself, that is, there would

Unknown Speaker  49:58  
you explain in a. Is

Unknown Speaker  50:07  
not like

Speaker 8  50:16  
compelling did you feel differently?

Speaker 2  50:26  
Graph showed that there is no more thinking, and then there can be information conveyed by different agencies. Are there particular agencies so when I get

Speaker 1  50:58  
documentation For especially, yeah, so it makes look bad for

Speaker 1  51:25  
say I was reading here also how it affects your health, and how for the kids it affects their health, especially also for women who are

Unknown Speaker  51:36  
pregnant. You really trust

Speaker 1  51:48  
anybody in this section on this second one, I understood this area more than looks Like here. There is place point a little clearer.

Speaker 4  52:22  
Source. This is very important to me to know the

Speaker 1  52:35  
source. I cannot Okay, so here they explained all what could happen in sickness from lead getting sick by lead. But on the first page, I don't think they explained it with so much detail. So this one was a lot easier, and I feel more informed to so is

Speaker 3  53:07  
what I Hear. This is, should trust this information

Unknown Speaker  53:18  
on the YouTube does that affect

Speaker 3  53:36  
how much you trust the message that is given to you in this text? Do you trust this more? Come Do

Speaker 9  53:49  
you trust this more? She said, Yes, I trust this section.

Speaker 1  53:56  
And I asked her, Are there other sections on the right page that you don't

Unknown Speaker  54:03  
trust. This part is

Speaker 1  54:09  
responsible for the information, or is responsible for this website on the first on The first part two, it's also explained a little

Speaker 1  54:30  
easier. She says, Well, I asked her what question, what words like, I always spend time in the kitchen, and they mentioned the sink from the kitchen. So that really

Speaker 3  54:55  
stood out to me. So now that you knew this information. And you know something about what's going on. How does it make you ask, what next steps would you like to take? Having a certain

Unknown Speaker  55:50  
a [state].

Speaker 1  55:55  
So before I received my test from North Waterford, I used to cook with the water. I wouldn't drink those deep water, but I would cook with it like rice, but after they did my testing. Now I don't cook with the water in my home. I know that I have to buy I should buy it

Unknown Speaker  56:16  
or like this information, Michelle,

Speaker 1  56:36  
now reading more information, she said, No, I Just don't use the water I did the test. I know that there's lead paint, but when they do the test in my house, I don't

Speaker 2  56:47  
have like paint. Worry about checking this.

Speaker 3  56:55  
So when they let you know about the presence of lead in the water, when they explained that to you, would you think this information would have made things different for you? Would you have looked at it more differently, or would you have even used a tool that would give you all this explanation?

Speaker 3  57:20  
Now, in that situation, given a tool like this

Speaker 1  57:36  
that would explain what is being done, everything, if she found out that she had the lead,

Speaker 3  57:46  
how would she feel her water having a tool that explained the cause? How would that help her? Which even

Unknown Speaker  58:20  
information.

Speaker 1  58:25  
Yeah, this would be good because it showed us information on you.

Speaker 1  58:47  
It also facts like not knowing that boiling the water won't take out the lead, things like that. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  59:03  
I thought that if you boiled water, that it would

Speaker 1  59:11  
be safe and that you could drink it. So if

Speaker 3  59:21  
all this about lead school and all of that information, if presented through like a web page or a mobile app, would you trust it or what would you look for? Something to rely on? It?

Speaker 9  59:41  
Web, internet

Unknown Speaker  59:55  
and.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:08  
Elizabeth is

Unknown Speaker  1:00:20  
Honestly. For me,

Speaker 1  1:00:55  
awesome the internet that both of them maybe would not believe it too quickly, because there's so many things on the internet and there's a lot of wrong information. So she thought on the internet she probably wouldn't believe it. Also said she probably would doubt it, because it's not the same as someone who explains it to you, shows you the information and has a conversation.

Speaker 3  1:01:26  
What I understand is it's the human factor, like the conversation you have with people, that's making you trusted, rather than where the information is coming from.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:46  
Vienna information was the highest personal

Speaker 1  1:02:05  
I'm saying yeah, because when I look like the way you're speaking to me, and I know that you are. You have researched it. I believe you but like, if I saw something like this on Facebook, I probably like social media.

Speaker 3  1:02:28  
So we're working on a tool that delivers these messages to the community members, and working closely with [community-leader] and wata coalition to make sure that the information that the tool shares is verified before it is

Unknown Speaker  1:02:55  
made accessible and

Unknown Speaker  1:03:03  
[community-leader],

Speaker 3  1:03:10  
so for for you to trust in the message that is delivered to like that. What would you look for in that quality?

Speaker 5  1:03:21  
Como queremos. See

Unknown Speaker  1:03:37  
online, podemos,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:52  
present correcto,

Speaker 1  1:04:00  
if it had [city]

Speaker 1  1:04:11  
Water Coalition or an institution of health, any

Unknown Speaker  1:04:22  
thoughts? Any thoughts from your opinion on that? So,

Speaker 1  1:04:38  
the same as what Miss said that if it had our name on it, if [community-based-org] had the name on it, but also that I could coincide with other information that I've read. So if I receive this information, and then I could check if it's the same information on the application. That would also be helpful to.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:10  
All calculations, I

Unknown Speaker  1:05:25  
think these were most of the questions. The last question is mostly like, if we were building this tool, like the AI tool for which

Speaker 2  1:05:35  
was on the website, shows information about your watch, how are you going? People.

Speaker 4  1:05:55  
How do you want residents of New involved, if they could to come out that come out? Out that spread the word. I would like them to be involved. They got to be willing to want to do that to me in your life, if you're not worried, you're

Speaker 4  1:06:32  
not gonna do it more conscious about their health, more conscious about their kids. What she's talking about, because I think I

Speaker 3  1:06:41  
said that younger generation, know, I actually, like,

Speaker 4  1:06:47  
it was 50 years ago. I love the generational part you brought

Unknown Speaker  1:06:54  
up. I think you brought up a lot. Like, the chances

Speaker 3  1:07:00  
are for younger people, the anything in this message that you do

Speaker 9  1:07:19  
not trust, that you question? Please. No. One I found,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:32  
more informative compared to the first thing.

Speaker 3  1:07:44  
So if a tool that would make this easy for you to access, who do you think should be responsible for the information that is that it is giving you, who do you think should have more control about what is sharing so

Unknown Speaker  1:08:12  
Gonna application the last vacation.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:39  
Compiara,

Speaker 3  1:08:51  
so like, would you? Would you want the government to verify the message that the tool is getting or some more of like the locally established kind of organizations in cargo, they

Unknown Speaker  1:09:21  
actually start actually started, or

Unknown Speaker  1:09:34  
maybe you think the residential would Be a part of it as well. We have to

Unknown Speaker  1:09:46  
know.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:27  
Our organization, because we're the ones who have given

Speaker 8  1:10:34  
me the information the

Speaker 3  1:10:54  
uptake doesn't mean that just sharing their experience about what they observe differently in their water test results came Back differently.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:28  
With their house.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:40  
House.

Speaker 1  1:11:50  
Trust people like you who come and give us the information, do the tests and share needs, share with me. Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:12:08  
because I don't usually watch the news, so sometimes I'm not up to date. However, like, if I receive this information, I know I'm performed.

Speaker 3  1:12:19  
So generally, when getting information like this, how do you get it? Where do you look for this kind of information if you want to learn more, or is it through like getting text less, certain

Speaker 9  1:12:36  
stuff like that? Where do you learn about this water quality? Since

Unknown Speaker  1:12:58  
I know you guys, I would ask here,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:06  
If I didn't know you guys,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:22  
So [state] is como

Unknown Speaker  1:13:47  
he's the information from

Unknown Speaker  1:14:12  
you guys, I was

Speaker 1  1:14:20  
able to get the first page, then the second page really helped clear up, hearing it our information is really want to give her this and then tell the test, having asked this information. Do you think

Speaker 3  1:14:40  
any other type of information. What

Speaker 9  1:14:48  
is missing here? See.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:00  
Um Like, what other questions? What information do you think the residents, when

Unknown Speaker  1:15:22  
intended?

Speaker 1  1:15:30  
Oh, like explaining where the water comes from.

Speaker 9  1:15:39  
I this intended mejo

Speaker 3  1:16:08  
way, or maybe even if this was too much information in the same place, I know it's a lot of text, maybe some different way of explaining this would have been more useful for you, Like the person recorded video explaining all of

Unknown Speaker  1:16:30  
this information.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:42  
Candolo

Speaker 3  1:16:56  
may be too long, maybe just more of these pictures or infographics that explains things to You, some graphics do to Be

Speaker 2  1:17:42  
Awesome. A Yeah, but yes, this was like, this was Thank you. Thank you all for coming your time. We so much appreciate your time. We learned a lot from you. And thank you for pointing out, like your lived experience translating directly to the graph. It was like wonderful, like,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:25  
experience in line.

Speaker 2  1:18:34  
Yes, we did learn a lot from you. If you have any questions about anything, I think we can contact would be shared with them, right in some way. I think in the survey, they feel our contact should be there, right?

Speaker 1  1:18:50  
They should have their I can resend. I don't know. I'm not sure if they have, if they have it still.

Speaker 2  1:18:56  
Let me talk to [person], yeah, okay, we can talk about that, but they should have access to our contact. Our contacts. Everyone should hear have because if any at any point you have any questions, you should

Unknown Speaker  1:19:09  
be able to reach out to us.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:17  
Yeah, I think that's all. Thank you so much. Those

Speaker 2  1:19:27  
for your compensation. Thank you. Thank you. You

Unknown Speaker  1:19:39  
have backgrounds. Million you have too much digital data. How do we manage data?

Speaker 2  1:19:50  
Should we just or do we have like data should be deleted? This messages should be deleted. I don't even want my daughter to say. The outside,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:02  
would you like to keep touch

Speaker 6  1:20:10  
nuance? Because and

Unknown Speaker  1:20:26  
put nothing but Hello technology, we

Unknown Speaker  1:20:44  
have older people, age related changes so to

Unknown Speaker  1:21:07  
have access to this message we don't hear the input, we will be building tools that were successful. So in our city, we.
