Speaker 1  0:02  
Oh, so you mentioned you were a part of the mobile testing team where you covered about 300 homes. And you also were a part of team where they gave out surveys, and three different types of surveys too, which was internal for a grant and then post test survey, right? Yeah.

Speaker 2  0:24  
So no, the internal, so there was an internal one that's not really for grant, that's for just [community-based-org]. So that's, that's like, I believe. I don't know how they do it now, because when I was in high school, that's when I was mainly involved. Either got to college, obviously, [university] took up a lot of my time, so I wasn't able to be as active. But when I was in high school, that's how they did it. I'm not too sure about how they do it now, but I'm sure they have a Google form. It might be the ones that you got that, like the metrics they get from that might be you guys have access to you and Aritra,

Speaker 1  0:53  
so yeah, yeah, we did take a look at the survey report. I haven't looked at the survey directly. So when you interacted with the residents, what were the most common questions they had, or concerns about the quality of water?

Speaker 2  1:12  
So I would say, when it comes to when we're inside of the homes, I would say the main time they have questions, because normally the internal survey, it's sort of not gonna say, we force them to, but it's sort of like a pre screening before you come inside to get your food or water, which is like, hey, we asked a couple questions just for our sake, you know, just for [community-based-org] sake. But when we're actually in the homes and we're giving that survey, some of the main concerns was, sometimes, oh, sometimes I'll see like, discoloration in my water. Sometimes it'll taste funny. Does it? Will it affect me? Is there a way I could fix it? Or just things of that nature, things that they can actually are like tangible to them. It wasn't really about anything in terms of, like, what they can't see, but what they can't see, it was like the main thing for them. I would say that was their main concern. Because, you know, when you're a citizen, when you're a citizen, when you're just like a bystander, you're not going to really be worried too much of the science of it, but more so what you can actually see and interpret yourself.

Speaker 1  2:09  
So yeah, yeah. Did they have any misconception?

Speaker 2  2:17  
Um, I would say the biggest misconception was that their water, they weren't sure if their water was safe or was safe. At least when I was testing the water quality, to my surprise, it actually wasn't that bad, like you would expect every other home, but it was every couple I would take a while before we actually got like a hit, which is actually good, you know, because the whole point of this study is to try and figure out. To try and figure out, okay, is the water good? Is what are not good? So just having like public data like that, and doing like community science testing, but regarding that, the biggest misconception is my water safe, or isn't? Do I need to filter and things in that nature? So, yeah, that was, I guess that's the biggest misconception, yeah.

Speaker 1  2:59  
So you mentioned a few houses did have, like, a negative result, maybe elevated levels of compounds that you're not expecting in water, or was there any pattern that you observed?

Speaker 2  3:13  
The main pattern, I would say, is, it was so many, so long ago, but we had, I forgot the name of the tester is, but when we tested the water, there's, like, I think it was fluoride was a big thing that was coming up. Then we also tested for a long time ago, fluoride was like, the main thing. And then when we got hits in terms of lead, it would just be at random, I would say, in my case, it was mostly at apartment complexes, to be honest. Like if we tested one, then there might be, like, a high lead result. I was only around for like, two or three hits, but when other folks did their testing, I would read the group chat and oh, we got to hit at this home and this home. But the main thing was mainly the soil had a lot of lead, elevated levels of lead.

Speaker 1  4:02  
So whenever you found these anomalies, how did you report that to the citizen, like the members of the community?

Speaker 2  4:11  
So the first thing we do is we'd say, hey. So Well, actually at the end of the thing, I'm pretty sure everybody always asks, is there light in my water when we actually did get the hit on lead, we'll be like, Hey, you do have lead within your water system. So what we'll do is we'll take that, we'll take a sample, go back to our lab, test it again, just to make sure that, you know, there's no problem on our end, or any you know, Miss like error, you know, like error margin, things in that nature. And what we say is, hey, we're going to double test. And then we always take down the contact information. And then we would actually have an informational flyer that says everything regarding lead, and we would just pass that off to them. And then, since, like, we were educated enough to have, like, a general. Like, like, just a general script, like, Hey, this is the effects of lead. And then we would just leave. So that's how we just disseminated the information. It was basically the flyer. And then we would have people back at their lab, sort of, you know, contact them in case of anything. So, yeah,

Speaker 1  5:15  
I see. So apart from questions regarding lead, did they raise concern about any other presence of any other compound or anything?

Speaker 2  5:31  
I would say, I mean, led like the biggest thing, the biggest concern for everybody. Because, obviously lead pipes, I guess,

Speaker 1  5:43  
go ahead, you about like, where it comes from, what do we do? What can we do? Or where we can learn more?

Speaker 2  5:51  
I would say it's just hard, because it's hard to get people to care about it, to be honest. Because when we were doing this study, I would say what had a big effect on whether or not somebody cared or not is that we actually pay people for when we actually studied it, so that actually, I feel like, affected the information. That's something I noticed. A trend I noticed personally, is that it was more of a concern about making because we gave them $50 like, nobody's gonna turn that down. So giving that kind of like skews, sort of like people's opinions, whether or not they care or not. They only cared because they were getting money for it, some, not all. But I would say folks who are a little bit more, I guess, educated on the topic, or or just like, actually had concerns. You're like, oh, like, Thank you for the money. But I would say the biggest question is, yeah, like, they would be concerned about where it comes from, and what can they do? Who's and also the biggest thing, who should they contact about it, and how should they go about, maybe talking to their landlord or the government or things of that nature. So, yeah, so I guess the process afterwards, when you find lead within your system, so I would say that's the biggest concern, what to do after?

Speaker 1  7:01  
Is there a source that you found people trust or go to to learn more about the quality of their water?

Speaker 2  7:09  
I would say in terms of source. I mean, like organizations like [community-based-org] could be considered a source. I mean, they're one of the, like grassroot organizations within [city] that really talk about public lead testing and the importance of it, I would say, in terms of city or government, I feel like there is like a distrust within the community. So there's that, but they do sometimes we do have like me, even me, personally, I've received like a letter talking about lead pipes, like, oh, there was a problem here. I remember, like two years ago, they sent me, like a letter talking about it, and I feel like a lot of people mistrust that, so I would say it skews more towards, like friends and community members, but any like authoritarian figures or like government, it's sort of like a distrust. So, yeah,

Speaker 1  7:58  
see, i Hmm, so were they also interested in the source of the water, where they get it from, and the different types of filters they can use, or the treatments that are currently in place? What did they find useful to know about.

Speaker 2  8:23  
I would say biggest thing is just a water filter. Nobody's really concerned, if I'm being honest, nobody's really not too many people were really concerned about where the water is coming from, or like, the different plants that we have within [city], or water treatment plants that we have in [city]. I mean, not [city], in New Jersey, but I do feel that would be something actually helpful for a lot of people, because not a lot of people would think to think, oh, we actually do have water treatment plants in Jersey that, you know, go through our ward, and they don't know how the system works. So not a lot of people were concerned about that because, you know, they just don't think about it, like I said. It's just what's tangible, what's in front of them, just their faucet, you know. So the closest thing would be just a water filter on top of their water faucet. But, yeah,

Speaker 1  9:08  
did they ask questions about the type of water filter or what they should look for in a water filter when getting one?

Unknown Speaker  9:16  
Not necessarily? No, no, yeah, it's interesting.

Speaker 1  9:22  
Yeah, so you mentioned a lot of the participants and your program, they were they received like compensation for you to go into their houses and test it. So how did you actually reach out to them?

Speaker 2  9:38  
So actually, so that actually has to do a lot with the internal form. So we would say, Hey, do there? Would it be a question? Be like, Hey, would you be open to signing up to get your water tested? And before, and before [community-based-org] had one office, we actually had two on [loc]. And then when we do the distribution and events, we would have, like, a sign in sheet, or sign up sheet, if you'd want. Want to actually be signed up for the lead testing. And basically we just put in your information, so your phone number, your email and things of that nature, and then we would set them up. And I don't know the exactly the setting up part, because we had like a secretary who did that. She's no longer like with the organization, but I believe it was like an Excel sheet, and they kind of just put the name down if they got compensation or not, and the date that we would go, on my side. How it would work is, after they get signed up, they would get assigned a day in a time slot, and I would just write down to my notes. It was a little disorganized because we were starting out, but I would write down in my notes, personally, the address of the house, and then the time slot we would go in the day, and they would just have a family member, like, let us in. So that would be, like, the process just having them sign up, and having that question be a part of the form, or whether or not they want to be signed up.

Speaker 1  10:50  
So, yeah, okay, when people signed up, did you see notice any pattern regarding the age group or a certain neighborhood who was more or less interested in the process

Speaker 2  11:01  
itself, I would say it has to do a lot with, I guess, the demographic of people with a need of, you know, resources. So a lot of folks who actually show up to distributions are older, because, you know, when you're older, you have less support. So, you know, they were like, oh, like, oh, like, Of course I'd want to be I'd want $50 and of course I'd want you to test my lead. I'm older, you know, maybe I should care a little bit more. So, yeah, and I noticed I tested a lot more apartments than I did houses, like in my time. But houses were a big thing. But a lot of the houses were, like, shared or like townhouses, and it was kind of like an apartment complex. And you would, I would actually end up going to the same neighborhood over and over, because we had, like, a referral program where you get $25 if you refer somebody else. So that was another way that we got more people to, like, fill that 300 home quota. So that's why a lot of time we end up going to the same apartment complexes. So yeah, I

Speaker 1  12:03  
I see. So like in an apartment, did you just test the source, or did you check in multiple faucets within the apartment?

Speaker 2  12:12  
So the way we would do it is, I can't remember, all right, so we had three different ways of we had three different tests. So we had the water test for actually, but we had a we had something known as the XRF gun. I don't know if you're familiar, but sort of like a gun that she was like, like radar, like fluorescent lights. I don't know exactly, like this complete science behind it, but basically it sort of like penetrates into the wall, and test is, like the PB level, that's for paint. And then that would end up being that can also end up testing soil as well. So that was, like, the biggest thing. And what we would do is we would first map out and draw sketches. So I would draw some sketches of the house first, you know, A, B, A side, B, side, C, side, D, side. And then we would test like, Oh, this is d1 d2 we test door jams. We would test any like, like, high level places where we know, like, kids might play, kids might touch, so AC, like, what was it like, the window jams, anything in between. So a lot of, like, high level places where a lot of activity happens in terms of water, where we would test is usually the bathroom and then the kitchens, because obviously those are the main faucets, but most of the time would be the kitchen. And hey, would you also want us to get it from the bathroom as well? And it would be whatever the owner is comfortable with. Sometimes we would go into a house and only test one room because that's what they're comfortable with. Of course, we would note that down, and yeah. So that was the main thing we looked out for. And we also looked out for any infrastructure damage, so any leaking, rust, corrosion, things of that nature as well. And sometimes we would take a picture of pipes, sometimes we wouldn't, but yeah, that was all a part of our own certain survey. And then also we had the iPad, which was like a big thing as well. It played an important role, because one iPad was used for the survey, and then what would end up happening is that we would actually have a survey for them, and then our own survey where we list out, okay, we tested here, here and here, and we would list any pictures or any additional notes as well. So yeah, that was sort of the process.

Speaker 1  14:19  
So the tools that you use for testing, they were from the organization itself, and you use the same Yeah.

Speaker 2  14:28  
So [community-based-org], first, we had a we had borrowed an XRF gun, and what ended up happening was that, over time, was like, You know what? Like, we need something newer. So [community-based-org] ended up setting aside some money and buying their own. It was like 20 to 30 to $40,000 it was very expensive, but we ended up getting a new XRF gun, and then the other I forgot exactly what it's called. If you guys go over with [community-leader], I'm sure he has everything. There's like a sort of, like an acid kit. You. Um, with the water tester, I don't know if you're familiar, and basically you would put the water inside the it's kind of like a box, and you put the water inside, and then you, like, put the acid in and sort of test it. So it's like a triple test. I can't remember the process. It's been so long, but basically that was all provided by the organization. It wasn't, like, sourced by anything else. It was just purely internal. Yeah.

Speaker 1  15:21  
So [community-leader] did mention that he does not believe in the results given by those portable kids that are available online. And, yeah. So have you tried one of those? Or did you test it in any place to compare the results or something?

Speaker 2  15:40  
We actually never tested. I never tried using one of the portable, like, at home, like, probably off Amazon kits ever, actually, that would actually be good idea tell [community-leader], but yeah, so yeah, we actually had our own. So, yeah,

Speaker 1  15:58  
yeah, I knew I had talked with him recently, and he did mention that he does not find the results reliable, and also the way you're supposed to read it causes a lot of confusion there. So I was just wondering if you tested it out when you were

Speaker 2  16:15  
using and I would say one big thing, in my opinion, that affected it was like we were also high schoolers at the time. So granted, there were a lot of like, errors. I would say the water testing was probably the most important, but it was, like, the most intricate, because you have to follow a certain amount of steps, like you're dealing with so many liquids, you have to pour in and swivel around tabs inside of the water. So that was, like, it could have been confusing for some and then we had a lot of unreliable team members, so that kind of mess up the data a little bit, in my opinion. But no, that's granted in any study. But yes, I would say, hopefully now it's a lot more organized. I haven't actually been in one of the homes I might end up stopping by and probably like just rekindling and maybe doing a home one more time. But yeah, I'm sure the process is the same, though.

Speaker 1  17:02  
How did you get in touch with the [community-based-org] organization?

Speaker 2  17:07  
So when I was in high school, my friend was like, hey, like, have an easy job. We just give out water. And obviously, as a high schooler, you just want to make some quick money. So I ended up getting hired. And it started off at so that we have a church in [place]'s, which is an [loc] and basically every Saturday from nine to one or 10 to one, we would basically just give out water the entire time using the water box. I don't know if anything told you about the water box. It's basically like a portable filtration system. It's like, huge. It's kind of like, it's just a big filter that can be wheeled around, and you basically set it up to the pipes inside of any like home. You can do in a home or in the church, for example. And it would actually just filter out all the water. It's very cool. I mean, if you guys ever go there physically, you can actually check it out. We have like, two of them, and then we also have, like a portable, like dispenser for water. But that's besides the point. We just have a water box, and we just fill up jugs. And we encourage people to bring their own jugs that we give them, or they have, like, five gallon, two gallon, however much they need, and we just fill it up. And just over time, we would just accumulate, accumulate, accumulate. And even the water box has a match, like a counter that says how many water bottles we actually saved over time. So that was also a big thing. But anyways, we would use a water box full of water distribute fresh produce sourced by farms and donations and any grants that [community-leader] would get, he would use that money to actually go to, like, [place] and buy, you know, produce a boat just to give out, and we would record that. And after a while, we actually, right before the mobile lead testing unit, [community-leader] was really hammering down how important surveys were. So that's when we actually started doing the surveys. But basically, I don't know if you ever got in contact with with [person], but she ended up being that PhD student who worked with [community-leader], and she proposed that, Hey, we should do a lead study. So that's how I ended up working with [community-leader]. And you know, eventually we grew closer. So yeah,

Speaker 1  19:14  
do you know about any outreach program that [community-based-org] has to acquire more volunteers or get people interested in getting their water tested, not learning more about the water quality.

Speaker 2  19:26  
Outreach program the way I was recruited, it was more like, you know, we recruit from the inside, but I know [community-leader] consistently, like on Instagram or like, just like email blasts, like, hey, we need somebody for this. We need somebody who can do this and sort of, like, advertises it. But a lot of the time, [community-based-org] is a decent sized organization to the point where he's like, hey, I want to give the opportunity to people inside first, and then if there's room for people to join, we'll, you know, provide like a survey, or, you know, provide like a. Flyer that says, Hey, do you want to join? I don't necessarily think there's like a program, but I would say it's more so just like advertising [community-based-org] to just join.

Speaker 1  20:08  
See [community-leader] mentioned that you had awareness events and educational programs. Were you a part of those?

Speaker 2  20:19  
Not all the time, because, you know, obviously I was a high schooler, so i

Speaker 1  20:26  
Huh, did you attend any? Yes, I

Speaker 2  20:29  
attended, like, one or two. Basically, we, like, I said, we had two offices, so sometimes we would have information sessions, and sometimes people would show up. Sometimes at [place]'s, we would have information session after one o'clock, and what would end up happening is [community-leader] ends up presenting, talking about the importance of water. Sometimes we'd have documentaries made about us, and we'd have a screening for it, if anybody wants to show up. When we got a bigger office on South Doran Avenue in [city], he would actually host a lot more events. And yeah, I didn't attend too many of them, but I would say that it definitely was helpful. I don't know how the process worked in terms of, like, I don't know they surveyed anybody, but it was more so like, a formal, hey, come in and learn about lead and things of that nature. And I don't know if he advertised it, but [community-based-org] also works with a lot of organizations as well. So maybe some of them actually do some what's the word information sessions as well, about lead. Maybe we inspired them. But yeah,

Speaker 1  21:32  
in those events like educational programs, did people raise any concern? In specific that was very common. Very common,

Speaker 2  21:46  
if I can remember, the biggest question is, always, is the water safe? And if it's not, what can I do about that? What can I do, or what should I do? So I guess, for like, what you guys are doing. But Aritra, I guess, is just like, how not how can we make people care, but how can we make this? How can we make the information sound important enough for people to care and be like, you know, actually digestible. And it's not like, too confusing, you know. So it's just like showing people where to look and what information to look for as well. But yeah,

Speaker 1  22:25  
when you did those tests, all those meetings would be something more technical, like turbidity or the pH level. How did you explain those terms to the citizen? Like members, community members,

Speaker 2  22:40  
honestly, when I, when I was doing it, I didn't in terms of, like, the technical side of it. We never wanted to confuse anybody. So we just, we never use it like the scientific name for it. We would say lead, we wouldn't say PB or pH, honestly, because half the time they'd be like, What? What is that? Maybe we should have did our due diligence more and explained it a little better. Explained it a little better, but we always just chopped it up to the flyer, which is why I had told aricha, I'm like, Hey, I don't know if you guys can get your hand on the flyer, but that was, like the main thing that we were like, you know, just take your take it on your own time to just read through it, because it was very informational. But in terms of explaining, like, the technicality of everything, we just honestly, just dumbed it down a little bit, for lack of better terms, and just said, Hey, your lead levels were this amount. This is the recommended amount. Your soil levels were good. Your water was okay. Oh, and I forgot to mention we also did test dust, but I know we're focused on water quality, but yeah, we'd also say, like your dust levels, like there was any lead in the dust in your home. So, yeah, we just give like a general rundown.

Speaker 1  23:49  
Do you happen to have access to the flyers by any chance?

Speaker 2  23:53  
No, but I can. I'll text [community-leader] right now.

Speaker 1  23:56  
Yeah, jump to him as well. Yeah, see, so during all of this, is there something that you wish people knew better, like they had more information about or they could, yeah, so just something that you wish they knew without having to, you know, explain it more in detail. Well, not exactly, but you know, what would you like to teach people the most?

Speaker 2  24:28  
Essentially, I would say the biggest thing that I personally want people to know about their lead is, first of all, the effect it has on the people around them, I would say, for our general like, age range, yes, it was older folks. But the people who, I guess, tended to care a lot more about the technicality of it were like, you know, people in their mid 30s, mid 40s, who had children but also lived with older folks as well. So I would say, how does it affect the day? For age groups, that's important, who to trust, where to get information from. Like, if you feel like you want to stay updated on it, where can I get that information? Where can I get access to it in an easy way? And then finally, you know, what can I do about it? Where do I go if I need to submit a request for anything, or who do I go to? And, yeah, any signs to look out for, you know, in the future, if we're not here to guide you on that, you know? So, yeah, I would say those are, like, the biggest things, because it's things that people can do on their own. You don't want to do it. You don't want to, like, give information and it, the person who views it can't do anything about it, because at that point it's just like, it's useless to them. You know?

Speaker 1  25:49  
Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. So we're working on designing a tool that would actually, that would be accessible to the community members. So essentially, the information is simple enough for them to digest, and it contains everything that they need to know. So do you think the community members would be comfortable with using such digital or conversational tools?

Speaker 2  26:15  
No, I'm going to be honest like because then it just becomes the, how can I put it? Like, I think, like realistically, right for bystanders and citizens and, you know, non technical folks, non scientific people, it's when you introduce something like that, like a tool like that, you also have to be able to make it easy enough to, like, anybody can just jump on and use it right away, but if it's not accessible, like, in that manner, then it would be a conversation of actually having to, like, I guess, not host information sessions, but teaching people how to use the tool as well. Like, it's not just about releasing it, because if you just release it, that's fine, but if nobody knows how to use it, then you know, even though to you might be like, Oh, this is so easy, there are still, like, elderly folks, people in their 30s, 40s, who don't even know how to use the chat. GBT. So, you know, I guess making it, making the information digestible, is important, but making the app and the user interface is also just twice as as important, because if you don't even know how to get access to the data, you don't know how to ask the questions, not correctly, but you don't know how to ask questions, or which questions to ask, then you know that might get a little bit difficult, but I think it would be very much useful. And my only suggestion, I would say, is, you know, test runs and giving it out slowly to a control group, or putting it within the survey, like, hey, just as suggesting we have this app, and, you know, sort of working with [community-leader] to, you know, disseminate the app in a quarterly fashion. So I think it would be useful. But, you know, just have started bringing in people to test it, like, you know, have testers and be like, hey, is this, you know, I guess that's part of why I'm here, but, you know, just in that way, that's important, but I don't want to like, be like, pessimistic, but that's just my realistic response.

Speaker 1  28:09  
Yeah, it's so if you did have a tool like that, what kind of features do you think you or any community member in general would benefit from? You, as in, from the perspective of a volunteer as well, I would say,

Speaker 2  28:32  
I don't know the directions that I know from. I'll tell you what I think the direction you guys are going in, based off what I've heard is, I know you guys are trying to make an app that has sort of like an AI that utilizes an AI assistant, so we can ask it that that holds like a database, you know, and you ask questions, and it'll be able to know, give you like box plots and graphs and explain it and things of that nature. But that's all I know for now. I don't know if you want to give me a little bit of a rundown of i Yes,

Speaker 1  29:03  
we're so what we're doing is trying to connect what readings we have. So in general, summarize, maybe what the lead readings are, or any other inorganic materials, what the average is in that area, and explain to people. So this is what it looks like in general, and these readings mean something like, if, say, the lead is too high, amount of lead in your water is too high, then it could mean these health impacts. So what you should do is test it, and then you need to use filters so you can, you know, keep yourself safe. And we also try to explain to them the source so they can connect better, not cause panic in the community, explaining to them how the water is being treated, what measures are being taken, and where you can reach out if you need help. So if I. So I can show you an example of what type of messages we're working with, what we're planning to use. So let me share my screen so

Speaker 1  30:31  
you see my screen? Yeah, I can All right, so it's something like this. So about what is the cause? Where does it come from? Rather than giving them a chunk of text that they have to read through, maybe show some pictures, helping them understand where it comes from, and some other infographics, like, what could how would it affect you? How would certain chemical composition of the water affect you people in different age groups, and maybe an understanding of what it looks like. So in general, we found that the data from ngtp showed like low amount of lead and copper in the water. So what does this mean to them, and what they can do where they can look for information.

Speaker 1  31:30  
So in these lines, is there, as a volunteer, how would you like to intervene in this process? So what we're looking at currently is semi automated approach to this, so we'll have data stored somewhere, using the reports that [community-based-org] currently has feedback from [community-leader] or anyone in the team, and then that is what is represented visually, and is also used to craft the messages that are sent. So maybe in certain cases, we don't need a figure or infographic like this, and maybe we just need to show them like a simple message of like where you can find the information. So you wouldn't need a picture for something like this. You just need like URLs where you can follow what does this tell you about? Maybe contact information. Yeah, if you had as a volunteer, if you had a way to influence, a tool, a system that generates messages like this, how would you want to intervene?

Speaker 1  32:42  
What do you think would be helpful? Like, it could be teaching the LLM to write the message in certain way or include a different kind of information?

Speaker 2  32:58  
Okay, first I would say the tone, the tone of how the information is being, you know, given to the citizen, like certain AIS, I guess, obviously they're not human. So the way they say things, the way things are, are like, kind of robotic and sort of like thing and sort of like, not informal, very like, yeah, so I would say, like, the tone of the the AI assistant should be a lot more like, friendly, and more like, so things of that nature, like, I guess not like, not as scientific with it, because I think that's easier for people to read, You know. And then I guess any units given? Explain any units given because somebody is not going to understand a Greek letter just off, you know that. So that might be important as well being able so if the if a message is printed, if somebody was to ask a follow up question, how would the AI, you know, respond to that? Hey, can you explain this? I don't understand it. You know, things of that nature. And then in terms of infographics, I think the infographics are amazing. I think that's like the easiest way for people to understand it. That's how I do personally, just the infographic. And obviously, yes, it's important that if there's a question, Should we give them infographic, or should we just give them information straight, straight out? Straight, straight out? I would say that just comes with time, based off of the data that we're collecting. In terms of how I would intervene, yeah, I would just say tone. And if you're going to give graphs or maps or things of that nature, you know, the explanation has to be, you know, friendly and approachable for somebody. They were like, if they were to see it, they could understand it, not immediate, like, immediately, basically, like, they read it, and they're like, oh, like, I get it, you know, I'm not. And then where you're talking to people, not sometimes when you AI prompt, you'd like, oh, teach it to me like I'm a five year old. Teach it to me like I'm telling because not in like. Dumbing down way, but just like a you can't expect any prior knowledge from the person looking at it, you know. You have to any prompts like being like printed out are like, as if the person knows nothing about the topic, you know. So, yeah.

Speaker 1  35:21  
Do you think maybe including certain type of messages or certain features could improve engagement of people like they would actually want to learn more about what I would say?

Speaker 2  35:34  
I would say, I don't know if you guys are incorporating a map, but if the AI works with the map in a way and saying, hey, here are here's your reservoir, here's where the pipes might be. This is probably, this will increase the complexity of the app a lot. You know, I don't want to, like, throw work at you and be like, Hey, do this, but I would say a map would be definitely helpful, because in that way, they're like, I know where I'm at on the on the map. This is my blip. I live here. There's a water treatment plant here, if I need any questions, if I have any questions, or I need somebody to reach out to, in terms of government, where would I go? If you see on your map here, this location, things of that nature, so that way people like, oh, like, I know where to go. Like, it doesn't have to be like a GPS, but just, you know, giving people awareness of where to go. And then, obviously, providing links is important. A Louie folks are going to click the link, so where the links go, and the website also has to be if you're going to provide a link and you're going to say, Oh, this is going to be there, make sure that, I guess, include this section of where to go, because somebody might click a link and they're like, uh, you know, you brought me here, but I don't know where to go now, you know, so that's important as well, yeah. So you just have to be like, I guess user friendly, because your demographic is probably leaned towards the older side. And also [community-based-org] services, a lot of Hispanic, a lot of, like, a Hispanic demographic. So make sure that, you know, it's also the AI models, like bilingual. So you know Spanish is important. So yes, so yeah, I would say that's important. And then not just about lead, so other contaminants within the water as well. So other information will be provided because, you know, over time, we're starting to realize that lead may not be the full problem. There's also other contaminants within the water, so there might be, like, a test for that. I know that we're also focusing on PFAs as well. So yeah, but as you guys like look at the data more, I'd say you're going to develop more things. So I'd say so far it looks good.

Speaker 1  37:56  
So you mentioned towards the beginning that people don't really trust a lot of sources where they can get the information from, unless it's like an it's an organization like [community-based-org], where they build trust over time. So I believe, given that, they would obviously be skeptic about using a tool powered by AI, right? So in a situation like that, how do you think we can gain their trust?

Speaker 2  38:27  
So that's what I was talking about when I was saying, like, when you asked me the question about, like, do you think the community needs a tool like this, or do you think they would feel like it's useful? And I was like, No, it's because trust is, like, such an important thing, because it's sort of like unknown to them. It's going to be like, How can I put it, anything associated with like science and government, to somebody outside of the like, who's a community member, and it's just like with [community-based-org], like, it'll be confusing to them. They won't trust it as much. So I would say, as you disseminate the app and information about the app, I would say, add it in the survey, or, you know, to help people just see it and be like, oh, like, Is this useful? Or and work with [community-based-org] to give flyers, or be like, Hey, we're using this. Or have information sessions that say, this is how I use the app. And maybe they can spread it to their friends and be like, Oh, you don't got to call anybody. Just look it up on the app and, you know, over time, it'll have like a domino effect. But I would say, you know, teach a group of people, you know, have people sign up and be like, Hey, do you want to learn how to use this app and things of that nature? So, yeah, I would say just awareness is the most important thing. And then after awareness, it comes with, like, learning the functions of it, how to utilize it. So building trust and awareness go hand in hand. So have use [community-based-org] is sort of like that pipeline and be like, hey, utilize this. And you can even advertise it at [university], you know, so people can pass the. Message on,

Speaker 1  40:01  
yeah, yeah, definitely introducing it through an organization people already trust with give us like a leverage, but once they start interacting with the tool itself, the information that is provided. Do you think is there? Maybe we could use the site, sources like CDC or EPA to see this is where we got the information, and that's how we're explaining it. Because something that's common with everyone into the society is that if we see this is an LLM generated answer, then they are very suspicious about it. What is the source? How did it come up with it? Did it make it up? And are, you know, options like that. So just to tackle the situation like that, do you think that could be like any way that we could gain trust regarding the information itself that is included, something similar to citations?

Speaker 2  41:00  
Maybe I would say, like, citations would be important. And when you bring up, like, the CDC, and you know, other like sites like that, and other places where you get your information, like, be careful, obviously, how it's presented to them, because when they see things like that, and they see.gov and you know, they're gonna be like, they're gonna like, scratch their head a little bit. So I would say the best way is how the the model is, saying, Yeah, we got this information from here. So citing is important. Saying we got this information from here. But you know, adding always adding the why does it matter to you. How is it applicable to you? What, what you should look out for within this section, if I give you a link, where should you look? What should be highlighted, what's important, you know, or just, or just you know, I would say, like, just quote it. If you don't know what's important, I'll give you what's important. What's your question based off of the Site. Site, I'll take the information site and give it to you directly, rather than, you know, you asking that. So that way, you know, yeah, that way, you know, they're sort of trusting you, rather than they trust the information where you get it from, but they're getting the information from you, the model. And also, like, like I said that friendly tone with the model, and be like, hey, you know, we're the standard third and having sort of, like, a pure intent with the model, like, I don't know, not humanizing it, but making it seem like it's for the, like, greater good, or we're here to help you. We're here for we're not just here for efficiency. We're in support of community science. You know, yeah,

Speaker 1  42:43  
yeah, that makes sense. You did mention that a lot of the people you got in touch with came through [community-based-org]. They signed up during the survey and gave you permission to come to their homes and test it. But did you ever experience a situation when once you got there people did not trust you, or the tests that you ran?

Speaker 2  43:10  
Sometimes people will be skeptical, one of the main things that, and how would we call them now, well, I'll say why they're skeptical. So the first like sign of the main skeptical is that, like, they watch this very closely, and it's for one or two reasons. The main reason being, like, we're strangers coming in somebody's home. People don't want, you know, thievery to happen. People don't want to, you know, us to mess anything up, or maybe, you know, do anything to anybody in the house. Or so that's understandable. But there's also the second theory, which is like, hey, like, No, you guys are doing this, obviously, because you guys are getting paid, but you know, like, What's your intention? What are you gonna do with this data? And are you guys with the city? Which is, like the main question. We're like, hey, no, we're not in the city. We're doing an independent study that was, like our main thing, that was also our script, but like, Hey, we're doing innovative study. This is my team member. I'm [community-volunteer]. This is [community-volunteer]. This is [community-volunteer], and we're going to be testing this, this and this, and at the end of it, we'll give you a report about this, and most of their questions would actually be answered within that survey. So I hope [community-leader] can forward you guys the survey, because a lot of those questions were really helpful, and we actually always assigned somebody to be with them while they were taking the survey, so if they had any questions, or if there was any like, skepticism, they would clear that up. So yeah, so that kind of made it, like, more comforting and more familiar. So that's why a lot of the time, we didn't have too much trouble people being, like, too angry about us being the house or two, like, like, down our neck, because we had somebody with them on the iPad with the survey, and we they sort of went through with it.

Speaker 1  44:53  
So yeah, yeah, it sounds like a lot of human conversation. And the trust aspect of things, yeah, the communal, communal mindset, or communal psychology, and then that human front of conversation.

Unknown Speaker  45:21  
This was actually really helpful. Thank you so much.

Speaker 2  45:23  
No problem. Yeah, I'd hope so. I was talking with the rich, and I'm like, I hope I can help you guys in some way. No way. But, yeah, it was great. How was the meeting with [community-leader]? Did he have any comments about the AI model or, you know, rage?

Speaker 1  45:38  
He gave us a lot of insight into what people would be looking for and what they would like the people to know. He helps us get quite a few notes about how we can get people engaged, how we can make them feel proactive in getting to know more about the water itself and taking actions because it's directly affecting them.

Speaker 2  46:03  
Yeah, yeah, I would say taking action is also important. So I feel like, at the end of every prompt that you guys like that's given out, it should be like, you know, what can you do? Like that, what can you do, is just so important because, you know, it's one thing to read about, like information and but it's another thing to just be able to actually do something about it, even recommendations, like, Hey, here's this certified water filter on Amazon that you know, we know works. We've tested it like, this is the best, one of the best. Or here's a budget. If you're on a budget, do this, some good practices within your own household to make sure, you know, to contain, to stop. You know, your kid, if your kids play in a certain area, and you know there's lead there, like, how can you seal that off? You know, until the proper authority to get there in order to fix that? You know, what's your agency in the situation? Now, you don't want people to feel hopeless. You don't want to fear monger so that, what can you do is just biggest thing. Because when you're presented with so much data, even if it's a good thing, somebody might end up just getting fear monger, because they see so many letters they don't understand. Or they see like a metric, and they're like, 200 of what, or 300% of what. You know, I don't really get this. So, like I said, you know, as you guys are creating the prompts, like, it'll be helpful for like, you know me, for example, to read through it and be like, Oh, I interpret it this way. But also, even just a random community member to be like, Hey, can you know, do you understand this? So pre surveys, like, if you're presented with this, like, What did you gain from this? So, yeah, so even giving it to [university] students, for example, I feel like that would even be helpful, because they wouldn't even know what to do. Like, taking screenshots of some of the prompts and be like, how would you interpret this graph? Now, what did you take away from this? What are some follow up questions you would have, like, I feel like that's very important when creating it, so there's less room for error when you actually, like, fully release. Yeah.

Speaker 1  48:02  
Yeah, that would be actually a great way to progress make sure everyone understands what is being presented to them.

Speaker 2  48:12  
I would say things that will be helpful that you guys can get is just any data that [community-leader] holds. I was telling arisha that we had so much that we collected that not to use because maybe it's a little bit outdated, but I would say just to see the thought process behind it, see the trend and answers. See you know how that compares to now, maybe some things that were cared about before that aren't cared as much about now. So if you got if [community-leader] has that data store somewhere, which I'm sure he does in a drive, or things of that nature, or maybe about the process, it would be helpful, but yeah,

Speaker 1  48:46  
that would actually be great. It will give us a lot of insight and into what the community is looking for. Yeah, and any of your any of the reports that [community-based-org] generated could also show us what people actually need to know rather than asking them just, what do you want?

Speaker 2  49:04  
Yeah, we actually did have a paper that we are like authors for, even though I didn't write too much in it, but I if I can get that, I'll forward it to that. [community-leader] said he can forward me the flyer that we gave out when we tested lead, so I'm waiting on him to send me that, but when I do, I'll forward you an email.

Speaker 1  49:22  
Yeah, that would be great. Thank you so much. No problem. Not the paper. Do you remember the title or anything? So that I can go through it. If you have the PDF, that would be great. Yeah, I am one second. I

Unknown Speaker  49:43  
let me see. Yeah, I'd have to find it. But yeah,

Speaker 1  49:52  
yeah, anything at all, just the title, would also be fine. I should be able to find it. All right. Um. Well, it's almost been an hour. Thank you so much for your time. This was really helpful,

Speaker 1  50:10  
just in case, this is not like a have to but just in case, if you need more information, can we schedule a follow up interview?

Speaker 2  50:18  
No, of course. And also, you know, I go to anxiety. So if you guys ever want to meet in person, just let me know, yeah, and I'll be down. But yeah, just text me and let me know whenever you want to schedule another one, it'll be fine. Thank you so much. All right, no problem. It was great meeting you, by the way. Thank you. Thank you so much. Email me any questions or text me. Thank you. Bye.
