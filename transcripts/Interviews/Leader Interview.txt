Speaker 1  0:00  
I'll record. All right, we have a few questions for you to get to know the community better. Firstly, I'd like to hear what are the things that are currently in place that you use to share water related concerns the water related concerns the residents of [city] have, and what their priorities are

Unknown Speaker  0:29  
like, what what platforms we use,

Speaker 1  0:36  
mostly what they would like to know like they're like.

Speaker 2  0:41  
So it's always water quality. One of the things is that people come into our office with discolored water. So they're always, you know, the it's like, oh, this color is this water is brown, this this water is green. So they're, they're always curious about their specific water. Results. Then I think subsequent to that, it's more about like, Oh, can you tell me the difference with the filtration systems? Can you tell me the difference between alkaline and unalkaline water? People are we also test our water for pH and TDs every day. So we explain what the differences in pH is, we explain the differences in TDs. And then I think subsequent to that, it's like, oh, how come my water bills so high? What actually goes into this water bill, or things like that, when we find different contaminants, and then we begin to educate our community on that, that's when they also raise questions about their water quality. So like, Oh, why is there fluoride in this water, or why my water is hard, or my water might have calcium. So those are other questions that our community members ask.

Speaker 1  2:01  
Are there any misconceptions that you've noticed they usually have?

Speaker 2  2:07  
Yeah, the biggest one is, you know, I historically, everyone knows in order to get contaminants out of your water, you have to boil your water, but it makes things worse with lead. So that's one of the biggest misconceptions. I think also mainly because we mainly deal with lead, there's a lot of misconceptions around lead. Oh, if I shower in this water, if I wash my hands in this water, you know, cooking and stuff like that. But I think it's all of these, like, kind of, I don't want to say scare tactics, but it's, it's a lot of fear. So people have fear around certain water qualities, and then they they try to protect themselves, but then, like the things they're doing to protect themselves isn't actually valid.

Speaker 1  3:02  
So apart from you guys explaining to them after a test, is there any other source that they can tune into to get more information about the water quality?

Speaker 2  3:14  
No, most community members don't really trust government institutions, because they feel like they've been lied to. So that they they rely on places like the [community-based-org] in order to provide them with the most you know, up to date information. Subsequent to that, it's like Google I see.

Speaker 1  3:37  
So from what I understand, I think the biggest hurdle that they're facing to access more reliable and understandable information is the lack of trust.

Unknown Speaker  3:50  
Yeah, lack of trust is a big one.

Speaker 1  3:55  
So what kind of data or information, like the amount of lead in water, what types of filter to use, or even the source of the water would be most valuable to the members?

Speaker 2  4:09  
I think, I think a breakdown about water chemistry is probably the most vital thing, and then the misconceptions of like, Okay, what does it really mean to have high fluoride? So if you could, if people could explain, like, what fluoride is, then I think another thing that I think is useful is that there's a lot of charts out there about, well, this is the EPA standard, this is the njdep standard, this is the CDC standard. And the comprising all of those kind of standard points together would be very helpful. So, like a basic definition, a basis basic standards of exceedances from the different places. And then. Breakdown of why those exceedances exist and why they're different. And you know, you know, why does the CDC say no safe level of lead? Why does the EPA say 15 parts per billion in drinking water? Then I think the other thing that would be helpful is kind of like preventative measures. And then something that we also talked about were, like diets. So like, if you have a high lead, high lead in your system, what the what would a green diet do to protect or combat those lead things? Then I think, I think the one of the things that I've really been interested in is, like, the source apportionment. So like, let's say, if your home has high levels, but you don't really know where it's coming from, it can be coming from so many different points of contamination. And so I think a lot of people need help understanding that, and we do first and fifth leader testing. But you know, you can have be in a position where your first draw has like all these high levels, but then by the fifth leader, you're good. And I think a breakdown of the testing standard is also important. What do you learn in that first leader versus what do you learn in that fifth leader? And why that? Why do we do testing like that? Like, I want people to understand the process from start to finish, so that they can answer for themselves, or get answers through this model or machine learning model, like, the less loopholes or holes that people can poke into it, the more that they'll be able to trust it, and the only way to like, seal up those holes is to explain literally every part of just water quality.

Unknown Speaker  6:54  
Yeah, that makes sense. It's a

Speaker 3  7:01  
little Can I chat? Sorry. [interviewer-1], Can I chime in? Just in this a quick question. So how do you do that currently? [community-leader], like this whole system, the whole thing that you explain, what is your current strategy for doing that, and where do you find those when? What are things that you find challenging at the moment?

Speaker 2  7:21  
So a lot of the information lives in my brain, which sucks, because if I'm not around, nobody else can answer it. But I try to put my team on the same page so that they can answer some of the questions that that if I'm not around, I think the second part of it, the is that, you know, in my mind, I'm an expert on all this stuff, but I don't have a PhD. I don't have those letters after my name, and so I have to qualify myself. Hey, I've been working on this for seven years. Hey, I've been doing these testings for the last six years. Well, you know, I so that part, and overcoming that barrier always seems to be the first step, because people trust institutions. They don't necessarily trust the government, but they trust institutions. [community-based-org] being around for seven years has helped us almost become an institution where some people, you know, whatever I say on water, they will take it as like, okay, yeah, this is an expert speaking, but that the new person that comes into our community might not necessarily have that kind of same faith and trust in what I'm saying or the things that I'm doing. And then it's like, you know, I can only imagine what, what some like, doctors say, Oh, you you Googled your symptoms. Or, you know, people go online and they find all this research that of whatever echo chamber they belong to, and they're like, Well, I heard this, and I heard this about water, and not your water tastes like this, and it's just like, there's, you know, we use. So I always have to explain ourselves in order to get that trust. And then once I have that trust, people are then more inclined to believe the things that we have to say about water. And the really, the strategy is, is that the knowledge shouldn't just live in one person. Unfortunately, it tends to live in me. But I mean, I'm the one who's been doing this for so long, so I've been trying to slowly educate kind of my staff and my team and community members on water quality issues so that they can better help the community and understand you know, I think that when you have a deep understanding of issues and water quality, then it's easier for you to kind of navigate in some of these spaces. Yeah,

Speaker 1  9:43  
you mentioned, you need to earn the trust before they believe the information that you're sharing, and also that they don't really trust the government sources when it comes to such information, is there any specific tactic you use, like citing some of the. Institutions they trust, or just talk about your experience.

Speaker 2  10:06  
It really is, talking about the experience, and then like demonstrating the testing that we do. You know, it's one of the things is you we can start studies, and that's good for certain levels of people in the community. They're like, Oh yeah, you know, you're citing a study. Other people just don't even believe the studies. And so when I tell them, Well, I'm like, well, actually, we're the ones that did this research. We're the ones that collected this information. So our ownership of every level of the of the data, the information, the articles, and the, you know now, the actual machine learning, it's like, you can trust this, because we're the ones that are building this system. We're the ones that have the knowledge, and then we're the ones actually collecting the stuff in the field. So it's like if you trust the [community-based-org], because you get water and food from us, you will trust us based off of the research that we're doing. And that's what's been a really big, big key of building that trust. It's like, if you, if you get food from us, why wouldn't you trust us on our research stuff and so and, you know, it just becomes like a loop in a way.

Speaker 3  11:16  
This is so interesting. Like, I love how you are institutionalizing trust in several ways. But also, like, do you see that could be some trade offs of using an AI system in terms of, like, the thing you brought up about people trusting because, because they have worked with you, with with but also, like, then people trusting more of some of the standardized things from EPA, that kind of thing. But thinking about like this, different layers of trust. Do you think what could be some of those things we should keep in mind as we are building an AI system, an automated system, let's just

Speaker 2  11:58  
say the biggest thing I think, in building the AI system is that none of the, I shouldn't say, none of the few models that I've seen lack culture. They lack any type of the value system of of whatever, because it's an AI system. So they're just trying to cast the widest net. And we're not trying to catch the widest net. We're trying to build a system that has a lot of the community values and cultural values of the [community-based-org]. And so I think some that's very, very hard to do in an AI model, but I think that there's certain things like, again, with we're explaining what this chemical is, if we're talking about diet and nutrition, if we're talking about, you know, all of these kind of fundamental things that people don't necessarily think about, and we put those concepts into the algorithm or whatever value system that we're creating, I think that's What's going to separate [community-based-org]s, machine learning model from everyone else, and that's what I really, really, really, really want to emphasize. Like, how do we put our cultural values of our community organization in this machine learning model? And I don't really have a good answer for that just yet, but I think as it as the project unfolds over the next, you know, year and two and three years, that we'll be able to figure out a way to really put our cultures and value sets in this machine learning model. That, to me, that unique factor is what really is going to allow people to trust this is not going to be cookie cutter. It's not going to be the same as everyone else's. It's going to be unique to the [community-based-org]. And, you know, and again, what that looks like? I just, I don't know now, but I just know that that's one of the things that I want to start out with find as our foundation.

Speaker 1  14:01  
Are there like when we use an ML model to explain what different terms are, what the water quality currently looks like based on numbers. Do you think are there any risks or concerns that we should particularly take note of?

Speaker 2  14:17  
Yeah, I remember years ago, reading that like everyone that the reading level of [city] is like on an eighth grade level, and now it's probably even worse than that. So understanding that actually the something just popped in my head, but though just on that one point is just like making sure that the language information is accessible, and it's done in multi multiple languages, such as Portuguese, Spanish and English. And if we can do Creole, we can do Creole. The other thing is so making sure that the reading level is sufficient that I think it'd be cool too to. Some illustrations and some animations into this model as well. I'm a very visual learner, so if we can incorporate some of the visuals, I think that would be really, really helpful and make things digestible for certain folks, I would I'm very, very interested in sound and audio as well. So if we can create this kind of multimedia package through this machine learning model, you know, I could see it as like, the first prompt is like, how do you learn? And then that goes back to the culture thing, because it's not if someone puts in there, I learned through pictures or something, and then we can present the information in picture form. I think that'd be cool. I learned in sound or music, and find a way to do that. I learned in like just by reading and doing it that way, that automatically is authentic to the culture of the [community-based-org], because it's done in a way that's very unique,

Speaker 1  16:02  
right? Um, so when the citizen or the members of the community interact with the system, is there any information about how they interact, what kind of questions they usually ask? Would that kind of information be useful for you as a community leader, yeah.

Speaker 2  16:22  
I mean, it's all it's all useful for me, no matter what information we have. I think, you know, I'm always quite surprised. One of the things we we were using QR codes a lot, and then we realized that 50% of our community don't even have cell phones. So 50% of our community doesn't have cell phones. How are they accessing things through QR codes? And so it's, it's this kind of delicate back and forth, and this dance of like, okay, I know we can't meet everybody's needs, but if we're losing 50% of our people because they just don't have the technology for it, then, you know, then I have to come up with something different. And so I, I think that you know, any information that we gather is helpful for the [community-based-org] to understand who exactly are we serving and what, what needs they have, and how we can better serve them. And so if, like, you know, for example, if everybody's on this and they're asking about chlorine levels, then that means I need to do an educational program around chlorine. And so using what what information are people accessing through this model is super important, because that information can then filter into our programmatic needs. You could talk about different fundings that we need to look at, because these are the desires of our community.

Speaker 1  17:50  
I see you mentioned lack of access to I think [person] has a question. Can you share more about the educational programs, how it is conducted? What type of information do you usually share there?

Speaker 2  18:09  
Yeah, I mean, we've done education programs on like how to make your own natural skin care lotion, whatever face cream. We've done open mics that were around certain and specific issues. We've done community forums based off of like water quality reports or report backs based off of some research or data that we were collecting. We've done educational programs around mushrooms, how to cook your mushrooms, how to grow mushrooms. So, you know, we've, we've done programming on literally all kinds of things. We wanted to do something around how to can and preserve your own food. We've been doing a lot more. Or we have, [community-volunteer] has set up, kind of like a six month thing where she wants to do, like, a sewing workshop, a screen printing workshop, like, how to make T shirts. Wound care first aid workshop, blood testing workshop insurance, like, what do you what do you need to learn about insurance? So we've done workshops on pretty much not everything, but on most things or most different subjects. Um, it's kind of random. It's like, whoever. I'm not going to do all the workshops. But if someone comes to me and like, it goes back to like, when I asked, when people come to me and they're like, hey, I want to volunteer for the [community-based-org], the first thing I asked is like, what is it that she liked to do? Well, I like to talk about mushrooms and growing mushrooms. I was like, All right, then let's do a workshop on mushrooms. Would you like to lead that workshop? And more often than not, they say yes, and then we just do it. So the labor of these workshops don't necessarily come. Directly from the [community-based-org]. It comes from our community, and because it's coming from our community, and they're just offering this additional source, sometimes, you know, it's highly attended, then it's, yeah, it's definitely more than just water quality, but it goes back to it, because people trust us on the water quality stuff. So they're willing to trust us on these other topics and issues. And sometimes these other topic and issues allows them to trust us on those issues. So then they trust us on the water quality so for me, the community building is really this, like beautiful interwoven tapestry. And you know, it's, it's not looking at just water. We have to look at the whole, you know, the whole picture of everything. See,

Speaker 1  20:56  
you mentioned that about 50% of the current community members to not have access to mobile phones. So essentially, technology. What tactics do you currently use to share updates about the water quality? How do you spread the word that you're doing an education program or you're talking about the quality of water or chemistry of a specific like, maybe today about lead, what it does and how you test it.

Speaker 2  21:30  
As much as I hate it, it really is as pen and paper, flyers and word of mouth, nothing I I'm a very traditional organizer in that sense of, like, we need to knock on some doors, we need to, like, do some phone banking, reaching people that way. Text blasts. So it's like, it's like all of those things combined we have when you walk into our office, we have a table just a flyers. And the flyers aren't just [community-based-org] flyers. There are flyers from other community organizations, and just so pen and paper is because nobody had phones. So when we did sign in sheets on a tablet, people were struggling to type their information on a tablet, so it was easier for our community members to just write down things on pen and paper than to use the tablet. Now the younger generation doesn't have that problem, but what we found is, if we're servicing like I would say, 40% of our community members are 50 and above, and so if they've never had used technology before, then it becomes a difficult thing. I always tell the story one time a community member came in and just, he took the mouse and just tried to, like, rub it on the monitor, because he's never used a computer before. And so it really makes me think of like, you know, if we have to meet people, I hate that phrase, but it's like, meet people where they're at. So if you're trying to, if we're, if I'm thinking about that guy, and then I'm thinking about the kid who already knows how to use Canva to make graphics, it's a pretty wide gap. So it's like, how do we service all you know, as much as possible? So some of the things we've done, like, scaled back, or, kind of, you know, took the technology out of it, and then other things, we still try to utilize the technology. And then the flyers, people really like, people like things that they can touch and hold and like, that's a, that's a really, really big thing, you know, somebody wanted us to do newsletters again and things like that. And I'm just, we just really don't have the capacity for it, but it's, it's something that I've always wanted to do again. And, um, so it's like again, trying to figure out how we can meet the needs of all these folks

Unknown Speaker  24:02  
like Sorry, sorry to interrupt again. But can you

Unknown Speaker  24:10  
find I'm I'm sorry you broke up for me a little bit.

Speaker 3  24:13  
So what kind of content do you typically share on the pen and paper and the physical flyers?

Speaker 2  24:20  
So physical flyers would just be like internal programming, like, if we're going to do a special food distribution, if there's an event coming up, we try to whatever we put on social media, we have a paper flyer of that, and then, usually, if it's something bigger, we we print out those flyers, and then we give it out during our food distributions.

Speaker 1  24:52  
So when you share information with the community members, if you have. Of technical data, like, on average, the pH level of this zip code is a certain number, or the amount of level of lead that you detected as a certain number. How do you share those technical details?

Speaker 2  25:15  
So the first thing that we did was we created this, this report, and it was based off of all the data that we collected. And then, after we created that report, we translated it into Spanish, and then we had a report back day, and then we still have, like, the PDF version of that report, which anybody can access and utilize. So that, I think that probably be the first thing. I think what we haven't done a good job of is like, you know, that report lives, but we really don't push it as much as we should. But when people ask, you know, we kind of show them that kind of thing, and it breaks down. It breaks down literally everything that we've done. Then I can share that report with you as well.

Speaker 1  26:01  
Yeah, that would be really helpful. You also mentioned, like, explaining technical terms, say, like, turbidity. How do you usually do that? Do you have to demonstrate with pictures, actual samples?

Speaker 2  26:18  
Yeah, pictures, actual samples. Kind of breaking down, like, what? What's it in our water versus unclean water or bottled water? People really like looking at the differences between bottled water and our water. And that's really like, people like visual examples the most. And I think those are the most effective. And then it's like just straight up definition.

Speaker 1  26:49  
You see, do you face any challenges keeping people engaged and trying to inform them about the current situation?

Speaker 2  27:00  
Yeah, I always say that people don't care about water until they have to care about water, and then when they have to care about water, it's too late.

Speaker 1  27:09  
Is there anything that you do to keep them engaged interested?

Speaker 2  27:14  
So where I'm at today is because I'm more on the urban on this spiritual journey as it relates to water, especially working with indigenous communities. So I really, really am trying to work on people's relationship to water, and that, you know, it's not just about the drinking water aspect of it. It's about the cleansing aspect of it. It's about, we have two lakes in the city. It's about the Passaic River that's contaminated with dioxin, and, you know, all these other things. So you know, if I can get people to change their relationship with water, that begins to change this, like they begin to want to know more about it, like it's not just this other othering thing. This is a resource that we need to have a relationship with, and if you have a relationship with it, then you would care about it. You would care whether it's or not contaminated or sick or whatever have you.

Speaker 1  28:23  
What level of engagement would you want to see from the residents? As in, would you like them to send in samples? Just proactively inquire?

Speaker 2  28:36  
Yeah, I would love to see, like, really, really big engagement around water, I think like if people were more engaged about water, we would have more water protectors, and that would mean that people wouldn't tolerate it. People wouldn't tolerate these, these abuses and water systems. People won't tolerate contaminated water. People will tolerate, you know, just all these things. And I think that, to me, is super, super important.

Unknown Speaker  29:22  
Sorry, go ahead. [interviewer-1], I'll ask later in a bit.

Speaker 1  29:26  
I just wanted to know, how do you do the testing itself? Because you mentioned you collect samples and then you have your own data from which you generate reports. So do you have people come in with the water samples? Do you go door to door to collect them? What is the process there for testing?

Speaker 2  29:48  
So it depends. I hit a button. What did I hit? Okay, it really depends. We have people that come into our office to. That, you know, they're just like, I'm worried about my water. Then we have people that that are like, just in our in our orbit, I guess, and so they, they know that we do water testing or water quality sampling, so they'll always come to us, um, usually, if they not getting answers from their water department, then they come to us. It really runs the gambit. And then, because we have this grant with NJIT where we're testing homes, and I think we've, we're pushing close to 100 homes. Yeah, dollars so and then that's because we're paying each home 50 bucks to get their water tested. And then that, that's another, like, word of mouth thing. People are like, Oh man, I can get $50 for having my water tested. And then I like that.

Speaker 1  31:03  
Are there? I'm not really aware of this. Do we have, like, smaller test kits that the people can use on their own, so they can just send in the numbers, and you can let them understand, help them understand the results

Speaker 2  31:17  
we we looked into. I'm not a fan of the test strips, like the I'm just not, and I would prefer to use better equipment, like the best equipment we could possibly use, because that also is what builds a level of trust. It's like, yeah, anybody could use a test strip, but those test strips also can be false positives and show you things that they're not really there, versus using a special photometer where you're like, This is the science behind this. And this thing costs $400 so your $20 test strip is not inaccurate. But let's, you know, let's, let's use some a little bit different. Yeah,

Speaker 1  32:06  
hmm, so whenever you do those tests, if you find something negative like presence of contaminants or more than desirable level of certain chemicals, how do you usually break the news to the community members,

Speaker 2  32:22  
the first thing that we have to tell, or we usually tell them, is that we're not a certified lab, that this is an indication of a problem, and that's what we can tell you. It's an indication of a problem. You should get your water tested by the certified lab, and at the very least, you should be using a water filter, and then the water department of [city], quote, unquote, says that it will test for test for different contaminants. But the reality of the situation is, sometimes they test for the contaminants, sometimes they don't. But if they come to us and they get a test, what we could do is we said, so we'll take this test to the [city] Water Department see what they have to say. And that pushes the [city] water department to have to, they have to act on it, even though sometimes they don't

Unknown Speaker  33:21  
be had a question, a follow up question,

Unknown Speaker  33:27  
I'm sorry,

Unknown Speaker  33:30  
and [person], yes,

Speaker 3  33:32  
yes, sorry, I'm still, I'll just be reaching in five minutes and like, I'll get back on this. But my question is, I really love, Okay, a couple of things that have been going on in my mind with the breaking, the parts where my internet was breaking off. One is like, when you mentioned that you are everything is in your head. [community-leader], right, you have all the knowledge, and it's it's hard to communicate that when you're not there. Then there is another thing, like the the level of engagement that you were talking about. I'm going to talk about a couple of things, but I think there is something deeper to it, which I want to understand a little bit more. So the level of engagement people have with the water and the relationship with water, I love how you use the phrase relationship with water. So thinking about that, how would you want people's relationship what? What do you think is, first, people's current relationship with water? Let's start with that. And second, I would want to understand a little bit about how would you want the relationship with water to change, and to what extent and that we can dig in a little bit more.

Speaker 2  34:40  
Yeah, I think people's current relationship to it, especially in the US. What I've realized is that it's it's for granted this, when I turn my faucet on, I, beyond a shadow of doubt, know that water is going to run through that we're probably one of the few countries in the. World that has that belief that's not even a belief. It's like just this. It's almost like breathing air. We know that water is going to come out of that faucet, and we know that it's going to be supposedly safe for us. So it just became such a not even a first or second thought. It's just like it water will always be here, because, why hasn't it always been here? But what's crazy, especially in this country, is that that's actually not true for a lot of people, water access and water quality, especially, you know, I work with some communities along the border that have like, all kinds of sorts of water access issues. You know, communities in California, just, just all over and then that's just the water access part, the water quality part, like Jackson, Mississippi or Flint, Michigan or [city]. That's like a whole nother realm of things. But again, people don't think about those things until there's a problem. So there we have this kind of ignorance and this expectation that water will always exist and that it's actually not a finite resource, when, in reality, is very much a finite resource. And I think people are ignorant to that fact. And then I really, really, really, I will, at least when I'm giving my talks or I'm on panels, when I people ask me, like, what's the first thing people can do to change their relationship with water? It's one of my friends. We did a water ceremony many, many years ago, and he said the first thing that whenever you see a body of water, you know, or and I do this now is I put my hand on the water, and I thank you. I just thank the water. And you, the more you thank the water, the more you begin to build up that relationship. Because you're every time you're thinking this, this thing that is sustaining you, and then I think what I would really like to see, I would well, I mean, I definitely would like to see more people do that, but I think people need to understand the importance of water on a physical, mental and spiritual level. And if people were able to do that, then they wouldn't take water for granted.

Speaker 3  37:26  
I love that. I'll just cut off a little bit. [interviewer-1], if you have any final questions and I'm there, I'll be online in a minute. I think I'll get cut off in a second. Now, bye. Sorry about that. I'm so sorry.

Unknown Speaker  37:41  
All good. All good.

Speaker 1  37:48  
You mentioned building connection with the water itself on different levels, physical, mental and spiritual. Is there anything in particular that you wish the people understood about the quality of the water

Speaker 2  38:05  
I I'm in, you know, I'm in Brazil, and we've been working with the honey Quinn tribe. He said something that really stayed with me. Said, the the spirits live in the forest. And when there are no more forests, there is no more spirit, or there are no more spirits. And if the same thing is for water, Spirit lives in water, and the more we poison and kill our water, we are killing the spirits, and we're killing ourselves. And I think you know that is it sounds like it sounds real, intangible for people, but during covid, we were in the middle of our lead crisis, and the first thing they told you to do during covid is wash your hands. But people were scared to wash their hands because they thought, you know, they're like, well, our water is contaminated with lead. And so it's like adapting the very spiritual concepts and mental concepts into or adapting those tenants into the tangible and physical world. And if people could see those correlations a lot deeper, they would understand the importance. They would change their relationship, and they wouldn't take water for granted. So it's like, how do we make this real for people? How do you, you know, how do we take all the data and the information and present it in such a way that they're like, oh, I can easily understand this. I can digest this. Telling people that water has spirits on it doesn't work all the time, trust me. But you know, it's like another example is in my own practice, I do a lot of events and. And for me, part of my cleansing is to make sure that after an event, I shower, because I'm taking on people's energy. I'm, you know, I'm shaking hands, or I'm, I'm exerting all the energy that I have to be on this panel, to be at this conference, and, you know, people want to talk to me, and some of the things that I take on aren't mine. So one of the things I had to realize early on is like, how do I, how do I make sure I only keep what's mine? And a lot of that is how I bathe myself, how I shower and things like that. Um, not everybody's wanting to have that conversation, but I'm always willing to have that conversation because it's, it's not just about drinking water and that that's another level the water we ingest. You know, I the the vegans sometimes get a little militant about being plant based all the time. But even the waters, like I refuse to drink Dasani water. And in fact, I tell other people, I said, then they always ask me, Well, what water should you drink? And I have I drink problematic waters. I admit that, but I'm always like your water, look at the back. It shouldn't have any ingredients in it. If your water has ingredients in it, you should question that water, whether it's they're trying to remineralize it or not. Should just be water.

Speaker 3  41:25  
This questioning part is very interesting, [community-leader], and can we talk a little bit about that? And that goes back to the question about the level of engagement and involvement you would want. So right now, you said about a couple of things. People would come to you when they have when they and they would ask questions like, Why is my water looking like this? Right? Or they would come there is another sort of engagement where they would attend the community in events or programs that you're organizing you mentioned, and you're building that trust with the community. So thinking about like, what are the different levels at which people engage currently, and how do you want that to transform with time as a relationship with water changes.

Speaker 2  42:05  
You know, I've seen because the there's most people in general, are the for granted, who care less. But we do have, like, I would say it's probably less than 5% that are water people. These are the people that only use glass bottles. These are the people that know the difference between alkaline. I will love to see some of our for granted people move into that range. And I know sometimes even people in that range get a little wonky, but it's it becomes this whole, like, different, really, really different understanding of, like, body chemistry, water chemistry. And what I want in that change is really, really developing a community around water. And that's something that I really haven't seen in a lot of you know, you know, you you have these, I Flint, I think I've seen it in because they just had such a prolonged issue. So you have a lot of different water groups there working together, and there's a water community because of everything that's happened to them. Other cities don't necessarily have that, and it's super, super hard to replicate unless you have an anchor organization like the [community-based-org]. And then what makes us even unique in the world of water nonprofits is that we don't work on legislation. We actually work on water, which is kind of crazy to say, but it's, you know, I think I told you all this fact before, but we're the only organization in the state of New Jersey with its 10 million people that do what we do. So knowing that, I know that it's not going to be like the easiest transition to get more of our community members to care about water, but if we're able to do it, I think that we'll be able to create something really, really special and unique.

Speaker 3  44:06  
So Okay, a couple of things I heard is, like, maybe people changing their personal water consumption habits, that's something you would want to see, right? Or, like, developing a community. Can you talk a little bit about this community aspect? Like, is it asking more questions about water or what does what? What does that mean to you? The reason we are asking this is because we are particularly interesting in this, very much interested in building a community. But also, like there are specific nuances we are hearing. Like it has about the physical, about the digital environment and stuff, but also like understanding what does community mean, and what are some things like, is it asking questions? Is it sharing information? Is it or like, how do you think about this community around water for network residents?

Speaker 2  44:53  
Yeah, so, like, a institutional answer would be like, I would love a community water board. It. We need a check and balance to the public utility that's able to do whatever they want because they're in a position of authority to do that, there needs to be a check and balance and someone that can directly hold our water utility accountable. And I would love for it to be a community board, but the politics of [city] are such that like the mayor would just put a bunch of his lackeys on it, and then it just wouldn't be a real board, and it'd be kind of useless. But I would like to see an actual board take place. I think what community means to me is that, you know, I we have, like, people that get food from us, volunteer for us, people that are part of the labor of the [community-based-org], very much. So choose and decide how the organization is ran. They decide what issues we go after. Sometimes they decide grant and funding. So it's like, what community, community built around water, to me, is like, water is the entry point, but then it flows into all of these other aspects, of housing, of policing, of food, of everything. But for everyone involved, water was their entry point to the community. So from there, that's like the, you know, the starting point, or the jumping off point to tackle all of these other issues. We all, everybody, a part of our community, will fundamentally agree water is important. So having that that source be a value alignment is important, and knowing that that's the starting off point is important. Because when you start getting into the weeds and start arguing about all kinds of nonsense. We bring it back to we are all here because we know water is important.

Speaker 3  46:52  
Yeah. [interviewer-1], if you have other important questions you want to ask, go ahead. Because, yeah, otherwise, I can continue. But I'd first prioritize what questions you have you can go ahead. Okay, so i The other thing that really stood out was your thoughts on the test kits and the cheaper ones. And there was me, did you have some hesitance about using me, or did my internet was backing off?

Unknown Speaker  47:29  
Wait, hesitant about using one the the

Speaker 3  47:32  
test kits, the at home test kits for water quality?

Speaker 2  47:36  
Yeah, I just, um, I just never had really good results with them. And then the thing was, is like, because we used, we first started with the spectrophotometer, so we use the spectrophotometer first. And then some people were like, oh, let's just use these strips, because, you know, we can test 20 different contamination sources. And then it's like, well, is this and then I remember using one of the strips, and it's like, is this orange? I don't know if this is orange. What shade is this? It kind of looks like it's this number, but it could be in this range, versus the spectrophotometer is like, 10 ppm or 10 ppb, and you're like, All right, well, that's a definite result, that's something that I can stand on, versus like you're eyeing this test strip and you really don't know what color it is, and then that creates its own source of problems and issues. So I've always been hesitant about that. And then for me, if we're going to write papers on this stuff, if we're going to do academic research, then I want to get what we pot, like, the best equipment that we can possibly have without being a certified lab. Because then, you know, it's, it's, it's our biggest challenge to academia. It's like, we can do this work too. It's not that hard, you know, it's not that hard. So that's also what has given us a leg up over other water groups as well. Is that where we do so much in house?

Speaker 3  49:13  
Yeah, no, that makes sense, and it speaks again, to the to the trust aspect that you're talking about. But how would you feel? Okay, so the reason I asked about this question is we're thinking about the different points of contact, or even like engagement, between Nawaz Water Coalition and the residents of Navarre. And what we heard throughout, and maybe I might have missed a couple, is people coming to to you about to ask questions about the water quality. Let's say that when they're when they're seeing a different color tap water or something, they're coming to you to get answers to it. Then your team is going to the people's houses to test their water. And then the third one is through the community events that you're hosting like to build a community. Are these the two? Three, I would would you say that these are the three primary points of contact between what, between your institution and residents of network?

Speaker 2  50:11  
I would say the fourth is social media. As much as I hate it, I'm I don't do any of our Instagram or any of our I mean, I think Instagram is the biggest film we have. Facebook is the only one I'm willing to entertain because of Facebook marketplace. But those, those social media, is reality for a lot of people, even though I disagree with that. So a lot of people are consuming our reels or engaging on our Instagram page on different factors and different things that we want to push something out quickly to the most people. It is definitely social media amazing.

Speaker 3  50:53  
So can you share briefly, like at least? What kind of content do you share with people and the kind of engagement that you get. Is it different on social media versus people coming to you or you reaching out to people in person with answering their questions about water quality?

Speaker 2  51:11  
So the in person relationships are 1,000% more deeper. It's there's in our office. They're seeing our people, they're talking to us on a daily basis. You We can never replace that with social media. We might be reaching people all over the world. And you know, it's the it's the or what I personally found, at least with social media, is people want to see the most authentic and sincere things. We're not doing tick tock dances and doing all that stuff, but we have, like some of our volunteers speaking. Sometimes I'm speaking, you know, it's we're posting all sorts of different content. I am. I'm less involved than we have a volunteer marketing person now, so they're trying to make us a little bit more corporate and build the brand. When I was running the social media page, it was very much so social justice and like, I'm posting about all kinds of different world issues that nobody really talks about. I'm, like, really critiquing capitalism and the system and all that stuff. We don't do that as much anymore, but that's that was how I started running the social media page. And what I found is that there are people that want, want that kind of information, because one there or the algorithms on social media are such as that you're really living in your own bubble in silo. Our current Instagram manager is an anime influencer. It's someone that I know through a family member, and I thought, and we sat down and we had a conversation after he started doing the new reporter coalition page, and he goes, You know, I didn't know all of this was happening in the world, like my feed just showed me anime and the things that I like and you know, but now doing the [community-based-org]'s page, I'm exposed to, you know, farmers revolting in India, and you know, different revolutions happening across the world, and so is he. It was fascinating to hear him speak, because it's like people are really, really locked into their own algorithms, and they're not really seeing all these other things. And so you come to the [community-based-org]'s page expecting about water, but then we expose people to so much more, and then that gets them a little buy in, and then that's, you know, that allows that. I think our online community is very much different than our in person community, and there is some overlap there, but not a lot of overlap.

Speaker 3  53:55  
I love that, okay. I think we have, we do. I do. I'm sure [interviewer-1] also must. Might have thoughts about like questions about this, but I almost see we are at time. So wonder if we should take this information processes, because you have given us really helpful and lot of helpful pieces. One of the things we would like to pick your brains a little bit more about is the role of human and AI and the collaboration between the two when we are building such a system, because a lot of the things that you told us, be it about trust or the importance of the physical in person sessions, makes me think like the AI is just AI tools will be supportive or will play more of A collaborative role. So we would love to pick your brains more about this, but maybe we can set up another time for that, as we digest through all the important things it gave us. What Amina? If you have any final thoughts questions, go ahead.

Speaker 1  54:54  
I think I'd like to get your feedback on some of the content that we've generated. So. Are. It's a sample. It's still a work in progress of what we're expecting to share using the system that we're working on. I can share my screen if you'd like to take a look. Yeah.

Speaker 1  55:22  
Can you see my screen? Yeah, all right, you mentioned that the reading level of people within the community of the community members very largely. So one of the approaches where we plan to take to overcome that is to use visual aids. This is AI generated based on the information that we provided, and that would explain how lead gets into water, or how the different the methods that you mentioned that you've written down in the report that you just shared. So using visual information like these, using pictures where it comes in from to show the cause of the problem, and also a different kind of visuals to show how the level of a certain chemical within the water itself what it looks like within their community, what is the safety limit defined by other organizations, like the one we use this one is the EPA guideline, with a summary of what the numbers look like. The data we use for this is is based on the samples collected from [city]. It was publicly available in the drinking water data watch. And then we've also tried to summarize what the numbers mean to the people so they have an understanding of what the water currently looks like for them, and trying to keep it as neutral, so it's informative, but it does not create panic, and to ensure trust among the people, we're also looking at providing information, like where we got the data from, and where they can get more information. So one of the resources that we use to train the AI to use to not hallucinate and give incorrect information could be the reports that you currently generate. I think that would the reports that you generate more accessible to the community members, and we can reduce the difficulty of understanding the information using infographics and more visuals,

Speaker 2  57:49  
the two notes that I would say just looking at that really quickly, it's just we don't we. I gotten away from using the citizen word and just like community member, because everyone's a citizen in our community, and that kind of thing. And then I appreciate the neutrality. And there should just always be language about testing, like, you don't like, I always tell people I'm like, Listen, I'm not going to tell you, like, same according to our lead sampling we should be or their home should be in good ranges, but the only way to absolutely know is to test your water. So I would just like, those are the two things that I just saw really quickly

Speaker 3  58:35  
related to the citizen science thing. It's we definitely make note of that in the paper. But the point why we had it is because it's the larger research framing, and maybe we are thinking of getting rid of that totally will. But good to know about that. And again, like how we need to understand the political histories behind these terminologies that we use so commonly in research as well. And we should critique that too in the paper, if we if we use about, if we use that term,

Speaker 1  59:06  
another aspect we're looking at is to mention the health impacts, for instance, lead some seems to be something that most respondents of our survey actually are concerned about. So based on the EPA documentations, what we found is lead can have impacts on growth and development, learning behavior, lower IQ, hearing and speech issues. Do you also share like connect the numerical findings of the chemicals within the water to health impact, and how do you actually deliver that information so we can raise awareness and not cause mimic

Speaker 2  59:49  
so the we do, but one of the things that I feel like we can do better on is with older people and how lead takes. Place of calcium, I find that that that fact is usually because everybody focuses on young people, rightfully so, but it's also older people, and like osteoporosis and arthritis and like those kinds of and that population is always genuinely overlooked. So I was recommend adding that and, um, but it's usually done in this way. It's some kind of infographic. And then, like, the pregnant, I'm assuming it's supposed to be pregnant people,

Speaker 1  1:00:32  
yes, this is got cut off because of the dimensions here.

Speaker 2  1:00:36  
Okay, yeah, but I would, I would the calcium fact is interesting. And then just I shared this with your professors, there's a professor out of Purdue who's using an XRF machine to to scan people's bones for cumulative lead levels. So we want to start looking at that so that we can, we can directly talk about the health correlations between lead levels and you know what we're Seeing. But we haven't. We haven't gotten there yet.

Speaker 1  1:01:22  
No, okay, one other aspect that we're looking at is to connect what it looked like previously, the level of lead and what is being done currently, to keep it under control, like the lead and copper rule by EPA, and how it has called how it has impacted the level of lead in water. This is more of a textual representation of the data that we're working with, but we can generate visuals graphs to see how it has changed over time, and also talk about the policies that are in place, how the policies helped control the amount of lead, and how it is reflected in the numbers itself. I wanted to know if this would be helpful in increasing trust among the people and the agencies or organizations that actually come up with these regulations?

Speaker 2  1:02:24  
Yeah, I can also share. I just have a lot of time to do things. But we have graphics for when we first came out. We have PowerPoint presentations. We have I have, like the water quality reports that the city of [city] used to send out, all of this would be helpful in creating this kind of narrative and stuff. Do,

Speaker 1  1:03:03  
I think that's everything that I have to share right now.

Speaker 2  1:03:09  
Okay, well, you know, I will make sure I try to get these graphic I'll put it on my list. You'll get them at some point. I don't come back into the US until the 2020.

Speaker 1  1:03:21  
Eighth. 28th Oh, 28th Okay, yeah, if you could share those information, it would be great help in training the LLM to respond more the way you do interact with the community members accordingly.

Speaker 2  1:03:38  
All right, sounds good, and text, texting is probably the easiest way to get a hold of me. Do you have Did you, I don't know. Are you on that thread? The thread group with everybody, or not?

Unknown Speaker  1:03:54  
No. All

Speaker 2  1:03:57  
right, usually. So if you, if you just text me your first and last name, and I'll have a within 48 hours. I try to respond to people, okay, all right. You have a great day. Thank you. Bye.
